TALES OF NORTHUMBRIA
  </p>

  <h2>NORTHUMBERLAND</h2>
</div>

<p>
It is generally admitted that your Northumbrian
pre-eminently possesses the
quality which the pious but worldly Scotchman
was used to pray for, namely, &#8216;a guid
conceit o&#8217; hissel&#8217;.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
It is the more unfortunate, therefore, that
of late years a considerable landslip should
have taken place in the ground whereon his
reputation rested.
</p>

<p>
The local poet no longer hymns the
&#8216;Champions o&#8217; Tyneside,&#8217; for Chambers and
Renforth and other heroes have long since
departed, leaving &#8216;no issue.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Advancing civilization, again, has, it is to
be feared, made havoc of the proud insularity
of the Northumbrian squirearchy. No longer
are they content, like the Osbaldistones of
yore, to devote themselves to cellar and
stable, to stay at home, contemptuous of
London and its politics, of travel and of new
ideas. &#8216;Markham&#8217;s Farriery&#8217; and the &#8216;Guide
to Heraldry&#8217; have lost their pristine charm,
and the Northumbrian is, as a consequence,
foregoing his ancient characteristics merely
to become provincial.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Geordie Pitman&#8217; alone makes a stand
against all modern innovation. Firm in his
pele tower of ancient superiority, he is still
convinced of the superiority of all things
Northumbrian.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Champions&#8217; may have died out elsewhere,
and patriotism be decayed in the higher social
ranks, but in the pit-village there still lingers
an admirable quantity of the old self-love.
</p>

<p>
In each separate village you may find some
half-dozen self-styled &#8216;champions&#8217; who will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
match themselves against &#8216;any man in the
world&#8217; for £10 or £15 a side at their own
particular hobby or pastime.
</p>

<p>
Defeat has little effect upon a &#8216;champion&#8217;:
like Antæus, he picks himself up the stronger
for a fall, and having advertised himself in
the papers as &#8216;not being satisfied&#8217; with his
beating, challenges another attempt forthwith.
</p>

<p class="tb">
       *       *       *       *       *
</p>

<p>
Now this self-satisfaction&#8212;though somewhat
decayed of late&#8212;is probably one of the
oldest strains in the Northumbrian character,
having been developed, doubtless, in the first
instance, under stress of constant raid and
foray, and but little affected thereafter&#8212;owing
to the remoteness of the county both from the
universities and from London&#8212;by the higher
standards of softer and more civilized centres.
</p>

<p>
After this, the next most predominant trait
is a love of sport, for which the climate,
together with the physical conformation of
the county, may be held responsible; for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
open aspect of the plain, the crown of bare
western hills, the wind-swept moorland and
the sea, suggest a life of hard endurance and
fatigue, the strenuous toil of the hunter, the
keen excitements of the chase.
</p>

<p>
Still, as of old, the wide and spreading
grasslands try horse and rider with a tempting
challenge, as of one who cries, &#8216;Come,
who will tire first?&#8217; The music of the
hounds sweeps down the brae: &#8216;Yoi&#8212;yoi&#8212;yoi!&#8217;
quivers the cry from the streaming
pack. Onward the rider gallops, the plover
perchance rising at his horse&#8217;s heels, the long
note of the curlew sounding in his ears, the
breath of the west wind racing in his nostrils;
he may see on this side the purple bar of
Cheviot, on the other the blue, flat line of
the sea, and therewith&#8212;if ever in his life&#8212;may
taste of the primeval joy of living&#8212;of
the joy of the early hunter who lived with
his horse as with a comrade, drew from the
sea the &#8216;sacred fish,&#8217; from the moorland the
&#8216;winged fowl,&#8217; and knew not discontent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
The beauty of the southern counties is not
to be met with here.
</p>

<p>
The south is the well-dowered matron, the
north a bare-headed gipsy-lass, freckled with
sun and wind, who &#8216;fends&#8217; for her living
with strategies of hand and head.
</p>

<p>
Still, in the northern blood, the heritage of
the &#8216;raid&#8217; and the &#8216;foray&#8217; abides, and still,
as of old, are the children of the Borderland
nursed by the keen wind of the moorland
and the sea. &#8216;Hard and heather-bred&#8217; ran
the ancient North-Tyne slogan; &#8216;hard and
heather-bred&#8212;yet&#8212;yet&#8212;yet.&#8217;
</p>

<p class="pagenum-h-p"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h2>&#8216;A LONG MAIN&#8217; </h2>

<p>
&#8216;So you&#8217;re a county family?&#8217; I echoed,
and, though it may have been impolite,
I could not forbear a smile, for never
had I seen County Family so well disguised
before.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay,&#8217; replied Geordie Crozier, &#8216;I is,&#8217; and
forthwith proceeded to search in the pocket
of his pit-knickerbockers for his &#8216;cutty.&#8217; He
had just come up to &#8216;bank&#8217; from the &#8216;fore-shift,&#8217;
and was leaning on a waggon on the
pit-heap, about to have a smoke before going
home for a &#8216;wesh,&#8217; dinner, and bed. &#8216;The
last ov us,&#8217; he continued, having lit his pipe,
&#8216;that had Crozier Hall was grandfeythor&#8212;Jake
Crozier, of Crozier Hall, was his name
an&#8217; address, an&#8217;&#8212;an&#8217;&#8212;I&#8217;s his relics.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I glanced at the &#8216;relics&#8217; afresh&#8212;six foot
two if he was an inch, and broad in proportion,
a magnificent pair of arms&#8212;he was
champion hewer at the colliery&#8212;with legs to
match, though slightly bowed through the
constant stooping underground. Under the
mask of coal-dust his eyes gleamed like
pearls, and a thrusting lower lip, backed by
a square jaw, gave evidence of determination
and the faculty of enjoyment. A short, well-trimmed
beard put the finishing touch to
&#8216;the Squire,&#8217; for so his friends styled him,
half in jest.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, and how was it lost?&#8217; said I. &#8216;Was
&#8220;cellar and stable,&#8221; the good old Northumbrian
motto, his epitaph? Or did your
grandfather take an even quicker road to the
bailiffs?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Grandfeythor was like us, I b&#8217;lieve; he
was a fine spender but an ill saver, an&#8217; he
had a h&#8212;&#8212; ov a time till the mortgages
gave oot, for he was a tarr&#8217;ble tasteful man&#8212;lasses,
greyhounds, an&#8217; horses, racin&#8217;,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
drinkin&#8217;, cockin&#8217;, an&#8217; card-playin&#8217; were aal
hobbies ov his at one time or another, but
what was warse than aal this put togither
was that he never wud be beat. Everything
he had must be the best, an&#8217; the fact that
anythin&#8217; belonged to him was quite enough
to prove to him it was the best o&#8217; the sort i&#8217;
the county. Well, for a while as a young
man things went well o&#8217; him. He win the
Plate<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_1" href="#en_1">[1]</a></span> two years runnin&#8217;, an&#8217; many was the
cock-fight an&#8217; coursin&#8217; match he pulled off
wiv his cocks an&#8217; his hounds; but there was
a chap came oot o&#8217; Aadcastle who was one
too many for him at the finish. This chap
had made a vast o&#8217; brass i&#8217; the toon at ship-buildin&#8217;
or such like, an&#8217; bein&#8217; wishful to set
hisself up as a big pot, had hired a big place
next grandfeythor&#8217;s i&#8217; the country. Well,
grandfeythor couldn&#8217;t abide him, for, bein&#8217; a
red-hot Tory, he didn&#8217;t believe i&#8217; one man
bein&#8217; as good as another at aal, an&#8217; when, as
happened shortlies, his neighbour&#8217;s son came
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
sweetheartin&#8217; his daughter, he says, &#8220;No
Crozier lass ever yet married a shopkeeper&#8217;s
son, an&#8217; they never shall as long as I&#8217;m
above ground&#8212;orffice boys mun marry wi&#8217;
orffice gals,&#8221; says he.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, the lad&#8217;s feythor was tarr&#8217;ble vext
at this, an&#8217; he swears he&#8217;ll have his revenge
on the Squire&#8212;an&#8217; it wasn&#8217;t long before he
got his opportunity.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He&#8217;d set hissel&#8217; up as a sportin&#8217; man, ye
ken, when he come to the country, an&#8217; wes
tarr&#8217;ble keen o&#8217; shootin&#8217; wiv a gun, an&#8217; occasionally
he meets grandfeythor at a shootin&#8217;
party, an&#8217; always takes the opportunity to
differ from him i&#8217; a polite sort o&#8217; way on
every topic under the sun.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, after their dinners one day, grandfeythor,
bein&#8217; fairly full up wi&#8217; beer, ye ken,
begins sneering at all toon&#8217;s folk settin&#8217; up
as sportsmen. &#8220;It stan&#8217;s to reason,&#8221; says
he, &#8220;if a man&#8217;s forbears have never handled
a gun, nor shot nowt mevvies<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_2" href="#en_2">[2]</a></span> but a hoody
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
crow or a seagull on a holiday, that the bairns
canna shoot either, for it&#8217;s bred an&#8217; born in a
man&#8212;it&#8217;s part o&#8217; his birthright, like a fam&#8217;ly
jool,&#8221; says he; &#8220;a heditary gift, the same as a
proper knowledge o&#8217; horseflesh, fightin&#8217; cocks,
greyhounds an&#8217; aal; money won&#8217;t buy it, an&#8217;
it&#8217;s no use argifyin&#8217; aboot it, for it&#8217;s a fact,
and the will o&#8217; Providence,&#8221; says he.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Noo, when grandfeythor got on aboot
Providence, most folks, I b&#8217;lieve, used to say
nowt, but Smithson&#8212;that was the chap&#8217;s
name&#8212;he gies a sort o&#8217; tee-hee at this oot
loud, which would be the same as if you or
me were to say, &#8220;It&#8217;s just d&#8212;&#8212;d nonsense.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, there was a tarr&#8217;ble tow-row at this,
grandfeythor as red as a bubbly-jock an&#8217;
swearin&#8217; like a drunken fishwife, and Smithson
as polite as a counter-jumper wiv his &#8220;pardon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
me&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;pray be seated, sirs&#8221;&#8212;aal to no
effect.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;At the finish, when matters were quieted
doon a bit, Smithson offers to back hissel&#8217; at
a shootin&#8217; match wi&#8217; grandfeythor for £1,000
a side, an&#8217; also at a cockin&#8217; match&#8212;&#8220;a long
main&#8221; it was to be&#8212;twenty battles at £100
the &#8220;battle&#8221; and £1,000 the &#8220;main.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, aal the comp&#8217;ny thought it was just
a bit swagger on the part o&#8217; Smithson, an&#8217;
that when the time came he&#8217;d just cry off an&#8217;
pay forfeit, for the match was to take place
in three weeks&#8217; time, and never a cock had
Smithson in his place ava, whereas grandfeythor,
he had a rare breed, the best i&#8217; the
county&#8212;mixed Rothbury an&#8217; Felton&#8212;an&#8217; the
old Felton breed was the one the King o&#8217;
England win his brass ower formerly.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The time comes, an&#8217; the comp&#8217;ny is aal
assembled i&#8217; the cock-pit at Bridgeton,
grandfeythor, full o&#8217; beans an&#8217; bounce, backin&#8217;
hissel&#8217; like a prize-fighter, takin&#8217; snuff an&#8217;
handin&#8217; roon&#8217; the box to his friends, an&#8217; sayin&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
noo an&#8217; again, &#8220;Where&#8217;s that dam&#8217; fellow
Smithson?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, the clock on the old tower was
just on the stroke of ten, when in saunters
Smithson, cool as a ha&#8217;penny ice, an&#8217; behind
him, in green and gold liv&#8217;ries, come ten
flunkies each wi&#8217; two big bags behind his
shoulder, an&#8217; in each bag a tarr&#8217;ble fine
fightin&#8217; cock.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Where he&#8217;d gathered them nobody knew
save old Ned Stevison&#8212;an ancient old cock-fighter
o&#8217; Bridgeton, who loved cocks more
than many a man his missus. &#8220;The Moonlight
Breed&#8221; he called them, but they had
a strain of the famous old Lord Derby&#8217;s
breed i&#8217; them, and were blood uns to the
bone.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Some half dozen were Stevison&#8217;s own,
but the remainder &#8217;twas said he had stolen
from awa doon Sooth for Smithson, an&#8217; anyways
&#8220;Captain Moonlight&#8221; was his nickname
ever afterwards.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, they weighs aal the cocks; from six
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to six and a half pounds their weight was to
be, an&#8217; the fight commences.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Bob Stevison fought Smithson&#8217;s cocks
for him, an&#8217; grandfeythor fought his own,
kneelin&#8217; doon on the cock-pit floor wiv his
coat off so as to handle them the better.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The first two or three battles grandfeythor
wins easy, Stevison using his warst
cocks at the first, d&#8217;ye see, oot o&#8217; craft
mevvies to get longer odds i&#8217; the bettin&#8217;, so
that at one time grandfeythor was five
battles to two to the good; a bit later it
was eight all, an&#8217; the excitement was immense,
bets flyin&#8217; aboot like snowflakes at
Christmas.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Then Stevison oots wiv a beauty&#8212;a
perfect picture it was ov a fighter; eyes like
a furnace at night, liftin&#8217; his legs like a Derby
winner, wings an&#8217; tail clipped short&#8212;aal
glossy wi&#8217; health an&#8217; shinin&#8217; like mahogany.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Stevison runs him up an&#8217; doon the floor
to heat his blood, an&#8217; tweaks a feather doon
from his rump&#8212;that was a clever trick he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
had, to madden his cock just before the start&#8212;an&#8217;
holds him ready for the battle.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Then grandfeythor, he oots wiv his
champion cock&#8212;&#8220;Stingo,&#8221; he called him&#8212;an
old favouryte ov his, a gran&#8217; bird too, six
years old, an&#8217; a little past his prime mevvies,
though he&#8217;d never lost a battle in his life.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;As soon as they sees each other &#8220;Stingo&#8221;
gies a bit triumphant crow, an&#8217; leans forward
from his master&#8217;s hand to try an&#8217; nip hold o&#8217;
the other wiv his beak. The other says
nowt, just looks at him wi&#8217; fiery eyes red
hot wi&#8217; murder, an&#8217; as soon as ever his feet
touch the sawdust bends low, then springs
straight for Stingo, drivin&#8217; wiv his spur o&#8217;
shinin&#8217; steel right for his heart.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Just i&#8217; the nick o&#8217; time Stingo leaps i&#8217; the
air to meet him; there&#8217;s a &#8220;click, click,&#8221;
&#8220;click, click,&#8221; as o&#8217; daggers crossin&#8217;, an&#8217;
pantin&#8217; from the shock, doon sinks either bird
to the ground.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Stevison&#8217;s mouth was tremblin&#8217; like a
bairn&#8217;s as he took his favouryte up, for there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was blood on his lower breast feathers, but
Stingo wasn&#8217;t touched ava, an&#8217; grandfeythor,
puffed oot wi&#8217; pride, claps a bit mair o&#8217; the
fam&#8217;ly property on to his champion.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was a bit lesson for the other cock; he
was just as determined as ever, but a bit
quieter like; round an&#8217; round Stingo he goes
like a prize-fighter, clickin&#8217; in noo an&#8217; again
as he thought he saw his openin&#8217;, an&#8217; when
they grappled tegither wi&#8217; their beaks, though
his comb was almost torn in two, he hammered
for Stingo&#8217;s eye as a blacksmith
hammers on his anvil.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;After about fifteen minutes neither cock
could stand straight; at a distance you&#8217;d
have said they was both as drunk as my
lord; both were drippin&#8217; blood; Stingo had
lost an&#8217; eye, an&#8217; neither o&#8217; t&#8217;other&#8217;s were
much use to him, bein&#8217; bunged up wi&#8217; bruised
flesh. They staggered aboot here an&#8217; there;
knocked up against each other in a blind-man&#8217;s
&#8220;beg-pardin&#8221; sort o&#8217; way. Every noo
and again the Moonlight cock would pull
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
himself together, hop feebly into the air, an&#8217;
strike wiv his spurs, but as often as not the
air was all he hit, for, his eyesight bein&#8217; aal
askew, he couldn&#8217;t aim straight, an&#8217; doon he
would flop on his tail end, coughin&#8217; an&#8217;
choakin&#8217; wi&#8217; blood&#8212;powerless, yet mad to
gan on fightin&#8217;.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;At the finish he gets Stingo pinned up
against the cockpit bars, an&#8217;, thinkin&#8217; he has
him noo, gies a feeble craw, lifts hissel&#8217; into
the air, an&#8217; claps for his heart wiv his spurs.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was a bit clash in the held-breath
stillness of the place, then a tiny moan, an&#8217;,
by Gox! there was Moonlight lyin&#8217; flat on his
back on the sawdust wiv one leg broke in two
an&#8217; danglin&#8217; wiv its spur like a watch-chain on
his breast.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Such a hullaballoo as there was, grandfeythor
yellin&#8217; like an Injun! &#8220;Pick up yo&#8217;r
bird,&#8221; he cries, &#8220;he&#8217;s a dead un!&#8221; for there
was Stingo a-top o&#8217; Moonlight peckin&#8217; at
what was left ov his head-piece like a blackbird
at a snail.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
&#8216;Stevison never moved, but his gills went
flutterin&#8217; like those ov a dyin&#8217; fish; he couldn&#8217;t
speak, but I b&#8217;lieve he was prayin&#8217; for his
favouryte.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;A minute passed, then Moonlight comes
to; he beats wiv his wings, struggles,
crawls an inch or two, manages to shake off
Stingo, then hoistin&#8217; hissel&#8217; up once again wiv
his one leg an&#8217; wings slashes wiv his spur, and
by the damn&#8217;dest luck lands it in Stingo&#8217;s eye.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Doon in a motionless heap they falls, an&#8217;
when they&#8217;re separated Stingo&#8217;s dead as a
leg o&#8217; mutton.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The rest o&#8217; the comp&#8217;ny yells and shouts;
some says Moonlight&#8217;s a dead un, too, an&#8217; it&#8217;s
a drawn battle, an&#8217; grandfeythor, he swears
his bird can still fight, while Stevison, unable
to find his voice, picks up Moonlight, an&#8217;
finally claps a great kiss on to the middle ov
his back, an&#8217; when he sets him doon again
wiv a drop brandy in his mouth he sets up
a feeble craw of defiance, plainly axin&#8217;, &#8220;Who
the deevil says I&#8217;s a dead un?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
&#8216;After that it was all up wi&#8217; grandfeythor;
the stuffin&#8217; seemed knocked oot o&#8217; him an&#8217;
his cocks by the loss ov his favouryte, an&#8217; in
the next battle another of his best birds had
his heart squashed oot, like a ripe gooseberry,
at the vary first encounter.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was a black day that for grandfeythor,
but, as I was sayin&#8217; at the start, he never gies
in, an&#8217; he comforts hissel&#8217; wi&#8217; thinkin&#8217; he&#8217;d
make matters square up an&#8217; a bit to spare by
the shootin&#8217; match which was to follow in a
fortnight&#8217;s time.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Smithson had agreed to shoot off the
match at Crozier Hall, for grandfeythor had
aboot the best shootin&#8217; in the county at the
time, an&#8217; there was one place famous for the
grand shots ye got overhead between two
woods planted on either side of a dene, ye ken.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was stubbles an&#8217; beanfields usuallies
beyond, an&#8217; the pheasants, when driven off,
used to fly right across the haugh below over
into the woods beyond&#8212;mevvies aboot two
hundred yards awa&#8217;.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
&#8216;Well, the great day comes. A fine,
sunshiny October day it was, wiv a bit o&#8217;
wind from the west&#8212;the way the birds was
to fly, ye ken, an&#8217; a tarr&#8217;ble big comp&#8217;ny was
assembled to see grandfeythor gie &#8220;the
furrinor&#8221; his gruel.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Grandfeythor was i&#8217; tremendous spirits
that mornin&#8217;, an&#8217; as full o&#8217; gob as a torkey-cock;
nothin&#8217; could hold him; the world was
a toy to him&#8212;like the geography chap<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_3" href="#en_3">[3]</a></span> i&#8217; the
bairns&#8217; books, ye ken&#8212;he felt sae tarr&#8217;ble
strong an&#8217; healthy. &#8220;Eyeball clear as a
bairn&#8217;s,&#8221; says he, &#8220;hand steady as a rock,
digestion a marvel,&#8221; an&#8217; he pats hissel&#8217; on
the stomach as pleased as Punch.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;They tosses as to who shoots first, an&#8217; the
coin comes doon for grandfeythor, an&#8217; mighty
delighted he was to be the first to shoot. There
wasn&#8217;t much chance o&#8217; grandfeythor&#8217;s bettin&#8217;
as much as he wished for, for naebody thought
Smithson had a chanst, but what he could get
he gobbled up like a hungry trout&#8212;fearfu&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
odds they was&#8212;six to one on himself he had
to lay, an&#8217; often a bit more.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The match was for £1,000 a side, a
hundred shots each at the first hundred
pheasants within shot, an&#8217; the referee to
decide any disputed points.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Grandfeythor takes up his stand aboot
thirty yards awa&#8217; from the wood&#8217;s edge; then
the referee fires a pistol, the head-beater i&#8217;
the wood above waves a white flag, an&#8217;
there&#8217;s a dead stillness as though we were
aal i&#8217; church prayin&#8217;.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was a big clump o&#8217; fir-trees standin&#8217;
right oot from the thick o&#8217; the wood&#8217;s edge
about fifty yards off mevvies, an&#8217; two o&#8217; the
firs stood oot high above their fellows, an&#8217;
that was where the pheasants always broke
oot, whizzin&#8217; up like rockets as they came
ower the top o&#8217; them, an&#8217; it was just at that
point that grandfeythor had always nicked
them clever&#8212;just as they cleared the rise of
the topmost tree, ye ken, an&#8217; started on their
level flight for the opposite side. If ye
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
missed them i&#8217; front ye hadn&#8217;t much chanst
behind, for they swept awa&#8217; like lightnin&#8217;
doon the wind before ye could get turned
round. Well, aal was stillness as I said,
when sudden there comes a far-away cry
through the clear air&#8212;&#8220;Cock forrard, cock
forrard!&#8221; an&#8217; in another two seconds there
comes a clap o&#8217; wings from above. Bang!
gans grandfeythor&#8217;s gun, as a fine cock
sweeps overhead. &#8220;D&#8212;&#8212;!&#8221; says he, wiv
a flush on his cheek; for aal there was to
show was some half-dozen tail feathers left
twirlin&#8217;, as if in mock&#8217;ry, forty yards in the
air above him.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Cock forrard, cock forrard!&#8221; comes the
cry again, an&#8217; grandfeythor grips a firmer
stand wiv his feet, an&#8217; grasps his weapon a
bit tighter than before. Bang, bang! this
time, an&#8217; the cock gies a frightful lurch as
though about to fall headlong, but steadies
hissel&#8217;, rises a bit, an&#8217; wins over to the other
side.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;H&#8212;&#8212;!&#8221; yells grandfeythor, trembling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
wi&#8217; rage, an&#8217; stamps upon the ground. &#8220;Cock
forrard, cock forrard!&#8221; again comes the
beater&#8217;s cry, an&#8217; half a dozen come flightin&#8217;
overhead at once.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Bang! once again, an&#8217; grandfeythor wiv
a groan flings his gun to the ground, for he
had missed altogether that time.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;I&#8217;m fair bewitched,&#8221; he cries, and aal
the while the pheasants were streamin&#8217; overhead.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He trembled aal over, an&#8217; we thought he
was gannin&#8217; to have a fit, for his brow was
damp wi&#8217; drops o&#8217; sweat, an&#8217; his eye wild an&#8217;
glassy. &#8220;Thoo damned fellow,&#8221; he cries,
glancing round at Smithson, an&#8217; takes a step
towards him, &#8220;thoo&#8217;s cozened me somehow,
thoo must have poisoned my beer!&#8221; he yells.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Steady, sir, for God&#8217;s sake, steady!&#8221;
says the keeper in his ear, an&#8217; offers him his
gun again ready loaded for another shot, for
aal the while the pheasants came liftin&#8217; above
their heads.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, he takes it up again, looks at it an&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
feels as though he didn&#8217;t recognise it, as
though it had injured him somehow, an&#8217;,
tremblin&#8217; aal over, takes up a stand again.
After a shot or two he kills one in beautiful
style, an&#8217; gradually getting back a bit o&#8217;
confidence he gets warmed up, an&#8217; at the
finish he has seventy-five oot o&#8217; the hundred&#8212;oot
o&#8217; the last twenty never missin&#8217; one.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;And noo it was Smithson&#8217;s turn.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He makes a splendid start, wipin&#8217; up the
first fifteen birds wivvoot an error; after
that again the pheasants come wilder, an&#8217;
gettin&#8217; flurried belike, he tailors them. Then
he gets steadied once more, an&#8217; at the finish
has ten cartridges left an&#8217; seventy birds doon.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;A wunnerfu&#8217; chap for nerve he was, was
Smithson; the mair excitement the cooler
he gets.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;A hen pheasant comes sailin&#8217; awa&#8217; to the
right some sixty yards off.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;In shot?&#8221; asked he, as though he were
passin&#8217; the time o&#8217; day.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Shoot,&#8221; cries the referee, an&#8217; ping, ping!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
gans two cartridges, but he cannot stop her,
she was ower far off, though she left a trail
o&#8217; feathers ahint her.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He gets another fearfu&#8217; hard one to the
left this time, an&#8217; it takes two cartridges to
settle number seventy-one&#8212;six cartridges
left an&#8217; five birds to bag.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Wow! but the excitement was painfu&#8217;, an&#8217;
folks fell to bettin&#8217; i&#8217; quick whispers, &#8220;Two
to one against Smithson,&#8221; an&#8217; he takes it wiv
a nod, smilin&#8217; if you please.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The next three he gets, then he misses a
longish shot, two cartridges left an&#8217; two birds
to knock doon.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Here they come&#8212;two cocks high together
overhead&#8212;be-eauties; suthin&#8217; seems wrang
wi&#8217; trigger or cartridge, an&#8217; Smithson misses
first barrel.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;I&#8217;ve won!&#8221; yells grandfeythor, an&#8217; tosses
his cap i&#8217; the air. Bang! says Smithson&#8217;s
second barrel, an&#8217; doon comes the two cock
pheasants togither. The first had swerved,
d&#8217;ye see, an&#8217; jostled up against the second,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
an&#8217; Smithson cops &#8217;em both wiv his last
cartridge an&#8217; wins on the post, seventy-six to
seventy-five. Gox! but it was the nearest
touch an&#8217; go thing ever seen i&#8217; the North
Country, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d, an&#8217; wi&#8217; that last cartridge
bang gans Crozier Hall.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Was there any trickery?&#8217; I inquired; &#8216;had
Smithson tampered with your grandfather&#8217;s
cartridges, for instance?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;No, he&#8217;d not done that; he couldn&#8217;t ha&#8217;
done that, but he had tricked grandfeythor a
bit, though it wasn&#8217;t found out till afterwards.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The way of it was this: Smithson was a
d&#8212;&#8212;d clever feller, ye ken, an&#8217; knowin&#8217; as
he did that grandfeythor had a wunnerfu&#8217;
way o&#8217; pickin&#8217; off the pheasants just as they
came over the topmost trees, he had sent two
or three o&#8217; his men i&#8217; the night-time, an&#8217; had
fixed up a young fir right on to the top o&#8217; the
highest tree, so that Mr. Pheasant had to rise
another six feet afore he cam&#8217; ower.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, this was just enough to put grandfeythor
oot ov his reckonin&#8217;s, an&#8217; when he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
misses the first one, as he&#8217;d never done
before, he cannot make it oot, he went clean
flustered, thought he must have had a stroke,
an&#8217; swore he was bewitched, or poisoned, or
such like.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was a crool thing to do, but it wasn&#8217;t
exactly what ye could call a Jew&#8217;s swindle&#8212;but,
damn Smithson aal the same, I says;
for here&#8217;s me, Geordie Crozier, left a po&#8217;r
orphin i&#8217; the warld wi&#8217; none o&#8217; his fam&#8217;ly
property to belang to him, &#8217;cept two gifts&#8212;the
yen for drinkin&#8217; an&#8217; t&#8217;other for gamblin&#8217;,
an&#8217; it&#8217;s damn Smithson, says I.&#8217;

<h2>THE SQUIRE&#8217;S LAST RIDE</h2>

<p>
&#8216;Ay, that&#8217;s the priest, the Catholic Priest,&#8217;
said Eph Milburn, after a white-haired,
cassock-clad old gentleman, who had
nodded slightly in reply to my companion&#8217;s
greeting, had passed over the bridge and
departed out of hearing.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He looks as if butter wouldn&#8217;t melt in his
mouth now,&#8217; continued Milburn, a long-legged,
ruddy-bearded, hawk-eyed son of
the moorlands, &#8216;and aal his time nowadays
he spends in his garden over his bees or his
flowers, or thumbing his Mass-book in his
library; but it wasn&#8217;t so once-a-day, not he,
not when the old Squire was above ground,
and he came up by to stop wiv him.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ye&#8217;ll have heard tell o&#8217; the old Squire an&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
aal his goin&#8217;s on, I&#8217;ll be bound? Ay, o&#8217;
course, but there&#8217;s one thing nobody kens o&#8217;,
not even Father Blenkinsop, and that&#8217;s where
the Squire&#8217;s bones are lyin&#8217;, for they never
found his body, ye ken.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Squire Dally was the last o&#8217; the fam&#8217;ly
that had lived in the old Pele Tower o&#8217; Dally
from generation to generation, and he was
the wildest o&#8217; a wild lot&#8212;riders an&#8217; reivers
in the old times, canny hard fox-hunters,
drinkers, an&#8217; gam&#8217;lers this century. They
were bound to get through their property
soon or late, an&#8217; the last Squire, Tom Dally
o&#8217; Dally, he says, &#8220;I leave my property tiv
a South-countryman? Not I, by Gad!&#8221; says
he; &#8220;why, damme, but I&#8217;ll cheat him yet,&#8221;
an&#8217; sae he spends hissel&#8217; right an&#8217; left on any
mortal thing he took a fancy for.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The Hall&#8212;which was an old Pele wi&#8217;
two wings added, ye ken&#8212;an&#8217; a good bit o&#8217;
the property, had gone before that. The
last Squire&#8217;s grandfeythor had got shot o&#8217;
that, the mortgages on it bein&#8217; far ower
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
heavy to keep up; but there was still a fair
property left, an&#8217; a nice canny house that had
once been a dower-house, an&#8217; was now a
farm, an&#8217; that was where Squire Tom lived
with his fighting-cocks, an&#8217; his hounds, an&#8217;
his hawks an&#8217; aal.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;His missus had died early, ye ken, an&#8217;
that had been the ruin ov him, for she was
a clivvor woman, wiv a turn o&#8217; management&#8212;just
what ye would call good hands i&#8217; the
matter ov a horse; that was her faculty, an&#8217;
she was a bonny-featured woman for-bye.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay, she could manage him fine.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was a grand scene, &#8217;twas always
said, when he brings her home after their
furrin&#8217; tower, an&#8217; one night, bein&#8217; merry wiv
his bottle, he forgets hissel&#8217;, an&#8217; swears at
her before company. Up she gets swiftly,
pale, but determined, an&#8217; leanin&#8217; a wee bit
ower the table she speaks straight at him.
&#8220;Tom,&#8221; she says, &#8220;you forget yourself; and
until you apologize to me for your rudeness
I&#8217;ll sit no more at table wi&#8217; ye,&#8221; an&#8217; oot she
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
gans frae the dining-room, haughty as the
Queen in Scripture, leavin&#8217; the Squire gapin&#8217;
an&#8217; speechless, never havin&#8217; been treated that
fashion before.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was two or three other men wiv
him dinin&#8217; that night, an&#8217; on they sat drinkin&#8217;
steadily, the Squire in a towerin&#8217; temper aal
the while, noo damnin&#8217; hissel&#8217;, next cursin&#8217;
his neighbour, an&#8217; backin&#8217; his horses, an&#8217;
hawks, an&#8217; hissel&#8217;, wi&#8217; gun an&#8217; rod, against
anyone, or the lot o&#8217; them together.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;They tried to soothe him a bit, but the
mair they tried the hotter he got, an&#8217; had the
Pope hissel&#8217; been his visitor that night,
Squire Tom would have d&#8212;&#8212;d him too, an&#8217;
been glad o&#8217; the opportunity. After a bit
mair snarling an&#8217; sneerin&#8217;, an&#8217; snappin&#8217; he
sits quiet for a while, then he glares round at
his guest friends, an&#8217; he cries:
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Ye&#8217;re nowt better than a lot o&#8217; &#8216;momenty
morries,&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;meanin&#8217; skeletons, ye ken&#8212;&#8220;the
wife&#8217;s worth the whole boilin&#8217; o&#8217; ye, an&#8217; I&#8217;m
d&#8212;&#8212;d if I don&#8217;t apologize,&#8221; an&#8217; he glared
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
round to see if anyone would dare laugh at
him for&#8217;t; but no one spoke save a little
fam&#8217;ly lawyer chap, up for the night frae the
toon, an&#8217; he chirrups up an&#8217; he says, &#8220;Qui&#8217;
right, qui&#8217; right,&#8221; he hiccoughs, an&#8217; the
Squire glares right through him as he
growls, &#8220;When I ask ye for an opinion I
pay ye for&#8217;t, but if ye advise me unasked
again, I&#8217;ll fling ye oot at window,&#8221; he
says.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Sae oot he strides into the hall, an&#8217; cries
up the stairs: &#8220;Nell, my lass, Nell, ho-way
doon, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll apologize to ye, ay, d&#8212;&#8212;, I
will,&#8221; an&#8217; doon she comes, an&#8217; on tiv his
knees he gans, an&#8217; she holds oot her hand,
an&#8217; the Squire he kisses it like a lover.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, she manages him clivvor, but in
her first child-bed she was taken ill, poor
lady, an&#8217; dies vary shortly, leavin&#8217; him wiv a
baby girl.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;After that the Squire was never the same
man again. He turned reckless, for what
was the use ov &#8220;a filly&#8221; to him, he says; an&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
havin&#8217; no son an&#8217; heir to live an&#8217; save for, he
sets hissel&#8217; to spend aal he can an&#8217; spite his
next o&#8217; kin&#8212;a barrister chap in London toon,
whom he hated for bein&#8217; no sportsman&#8212;&#8220;a
priest-faced, pauper chap iv a black gown an&#8217;
wig,&#8221; he called him, an&#8217; no love was lost
between the pair o&#8217; them. He was a good
bit older than the Squire, an&#8217; had a largish
fam&#8217;ly, the second son bein&#8217; none other than
Father Blenkinsop&#8212;the priest that&#8217;s just
passed us by.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He was the only one the Squire could
take up wi&#8217; at aal, an&#8217; as a boy he was often
there for shootin&#8217;, an&#8217; huntin&#8217;, an&#8217; fishin&#8217;,
though his father liked ill his bein&#8217; there, for
fear o&#8217; his gettin&#8217; into bad ways under the
Squire&#8217;s guidance, who was gettin&#8217; wilder an&#8217;
wilder wiv every year that passed. He was
just a boy then, was Father Blenkinsop,
havin&#8217; left his schoolin&#8217;, an&#8217; bein&#8217; aboot to
gan tiv a college to be turned into a Jesu-yte,
an&#8217; nowt pleased the Squire mair, after a long
day&#8217;s huntin&#8217; or hawkin&#8217;, than to fill the lad
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
up wi&#8217; liquor an&#8217; sneer at religion, an&#8217; Mass,
an&#8217; priests, an&#8217; aal.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Chuck it, my boy, chuck it,&#8221; he would
say, clappin&#8217; him on the shoulder, as he
passed the bottle about. &#8220;Divv&#8217;nt put on
the black petticoat; ye&#8217;re ower much ov a
man for that. Ye can ride, an&#8217; ye can
shoot, an&#8217; ye can look a gal i&#8217; the face, an&#8217;
ye can crack a bottle, but if ye turn priest,
ye&#8217;ll neither be man nor woman, but a &#8212;&#8212;
bad mixture o&#8217; both.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;So he would talk o&#8217; nights, pourin&#8217; oot
his ribaldries an&#8217; drinkin&#8217; doon his wine, yet
never gettin&#8217; fair drunk; for he had a marvellous
stomach for liquor, had the Squire&#8212;no
butt o&#8217; Malmsey wine could ever have
drooned him, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d&#8212;an&#8217; the only way
he betrayed himself was by gettin&#8217; a bit
hotter i&#8217; the face an&#8217; fiercer i&#8217; his talk.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, one night he vexed his young
cousin beyond bearin&#8217;&#8212;what wi&#8217; blackguardin&#8217;
his father an&#8217; his mother, an&#8217; wi&#8217;
one thing an&#8217; another&#8212;an&#8217; sudden the boy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
leaps up&#8212;mevvies he was a little above
hissel&#8217; wi&#8217; liquor that evenin&#8217;&#8212;an&#8217; he bangs
wiv his fist on the table, an&#8217; he cries, &#8220;Look
here, Cousin Tom, I&#8217;ll stand it no longer, an&#8217;
to prove I&#8217;m no coward, I&#8217;ll challenge ye to
ride to the big Black Stone on Glowrorum
Fell an&#8217; back across the Moor this very
night.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Done wi&#8217; ye, lad, done wi&#8217; ye!&#8221; shouts
the Squire, bangin&#8217; wiv his fist in his turn,
&#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell ye what the stakes shall be. If
I win, you chuck the Jesu-yte business an&#8217;
come an&#8217; live wi&#8217; me, an&#8217; if you win, you can
take your pick o&#8217; the horses i&#8217; my stable.
Agreed?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Ay!&#8221; shouted the boy recklessly; &#8220;done
wi&#8217; ye.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Fifteen minutes after this the two o&#8217; them
starts off with a wild hallo up the brae side,
an&#8217; so across the Moor, the Squire &#8220;yoickin&#8217;&#8221;
an&#8217; &#8220;tally-hooin&#8217;&#8221; as he went.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The Moor was mevvies aboot two miles
across&#8212;an&#8217; a tarr&#8217;ble bad place for hard
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
gallopin&#8217;, for there was a stone wall or two
i&#8217; the middle o&#8217;t, bogs to the left hand, an&#8217;
some old workin&#8217;s&#8212;pit-shafts or the like&#8212;to
the right.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;So right across Towlerhirst Moor they
galloped&#8212;hell-to-leather&#8212;the Squire to the
right an&#8217; the boy to the left.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Tom Brewis, the old herd up at Windyneuk,
happened to be passin&#8217; along the sheep-track
that leads by the Moor edge that night,
an&#8217; hearin&#8217; the sound ov a horse gallopin&#8217;, an&#8217;
a lively hollerin&#8217; as tho&#8217; to a pack o&#8217; hounds,
he comes across a bit to find oot what it
might be.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was a dampish, daggyish sort o&#8217; night,
but at times there was a drift o&#8217; moonlight,
an&#8217; in one o&#8217; thae glimpses he caught a sight
ov a dark figure on horseback, aboot two
hundred yards from him, tryin&#8217; to jump a
big black horse across one o&#8217; thae open
shafts. &#8220;You won&#8217;t, won&#8217;t you? Then
d&#8212;&#8212; ye, ye &#8212;&#8212; black de&#8217;il, ye shall!&#8221; an&#8217;
clappin&#8217; his spurs deep into his sides, an&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
layin&#8217; his huntin&#8217; crop aboot his ears, he
forced him some paces backward an&#8217; sent
him at it again.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was a big black stallion he was ridin&#8217;&#8212;a
fiery-tempered brute, a proper match for
the Squire&#8212;an&#8217; up he reared on end, fightin&#8217;
him, shriekin&#8217; wi&#8217; pain an&#8217; rage; but he
couldn&#8217;t get shot ov his rider, so wiv a
sudden bound he starts forward an&#8217; tries to
clear the shaft wiv one great leap.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Just at that moment the moonlight faded,
an&#8217; Tom Brewis couldn&#8217;t tell exactly what
happened, but he saw a dark mass leapin&#8217;,
he heard a rattle o&#8217; stones, then a heavy thud
deep down somewhere, a sort o&#8217; splash, an&#8217;
aal was still.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Tom stands there aal a-gliff wi&#8217; terror,
half dazed, not kennin&#8217; whether he can have
seen or heard aright; then, pullin&#8217; hissel&#8217;
together, walks slowly thither to see if any
trace can be seen of horse or rider.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;But there wasn&#8217;t a one&#8212;neither o&#8217; horse
nor Squire&#8212;nowt but a tramplin&#8217; o&#8217; horse&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
hoofs an&#8217; a white gash as o&#8217; a half horse-shoe
on a big boulder o&#8217; rock two feet below the
surface t&#8217;other side. Sae Tom gans slowly
back, an&#8217; doon to the Squire&#8217;s house to find
if he can hear anything ov him doon there;
for he half hoped it might be a sort o&#8217; dream
after aal.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Just as he gets to the door a figure comes
up the drive leadin&#8217; to the house, draggin&#8217;
a lame horse after him, an&#8217; &#8220;Ha ye seen
anything o&#8217; the Squire?&#8221; it shouts at him.
&#8220;No-o,&#8221; says Tom, startled-like, &#8220;that was
just what I was comin&#8217; to ask for myself;&#8221;
an&#8217; he peers through the shadows to see who
his questioner could be, an&#8217; recognises Master
Fred, the Squire&#8217;s cousin, bleedin&#8217; frae a
wound i&#8217; the head, an&#8217; leadin&#8217; a horse wi&#8217; two
fearfu&#8217; broken knees.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He win his wager,&#8217; concluded my companion
slowly, &#8216;but after that ride he was
never the lad he had been before, an&#8217; perhaps
it&#8217;s scarcely likely that he should be, I&#8217;m
thinkin&#8217;.&#8217;

We were standing on the fencing-room
floor&#8212;Jake Carruthers and I&#8212;leaning
our backs against the armoury, our foils
still in our hands, slowly recovering our
breath, after a rapier and dagger contest
which had lasted a good half-hour.
</p>

<p>
He was much less &#8216;winded&#8217; than myself,
for all his sixty-five years; and as I had
positively worn myself out against his iron
wrist I was delighted to gain a breathing
space, and occupied the time in drawing out
from my companion some old-time memories
of the fencing floor.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Have you ever seen a duel?&#8217; I inquired.
&#8216;I don&#8217;t mean a semi-drunken, nose-chopping
bout, or a garden-party affair, with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
coffee and liqueurs, as in France, but a
genuine &#8220;throat-cutting, blood-letting&#8221;
matter, such as Porthos or D&#8217;Artagnan
would have loved?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;No,&#8217; replied Jake reflectively, drawing the
length of his foil lovingly along the soft sleeve
of his jacket; &#8216;the time&#8217;s past, I doubt, for
that sort of performance. The Divorce
Court is what &#8220;my lord&#8221; appeals to nowadays
for &#8220;satisfaction,&#8221; and Trimmer Joe or
Bricklayer Tom, they just &#8220;bash&#8221; the trespasser
upon their family preserves on the
head, and there&#8217;s an end on&#8217;t.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The cleverest, best-fought fight I ever
saw&#8212;and I believe there was a bit something
of what you&#8217;re meanin&#8217; in it&#8212;was,
strange to say, twixt a man and a woman&#8212;leastways,
a gentleman an&#8217; a lady. It was
a fair battle, proper fightin&#8217; on her side; for
she was sworn to win, and sair wishful to
punish him, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d; and he, though he
was tarr&#8217;ble keen to win too, found it took
him all his time to keep her from letting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
daylight into him&#8212;an&#8217;, by the way, this is
the varra tale ye used always to be askin&#8217;
for, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell it ye noo, for ye&#8217;ve improved
i&#8217; your fencin&#8217;, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;, since ye began.
You&#8217;ll have heard tell of Squire Dennington
of Dennington Hall? A great rider he was
once, and a sportsman generally&#8212;&#8220;Jockey
Jack&#8221; his own private friends called him, and
his horse, &#8220;Pit Laddie&#8221;&#8212;ye&#8217;ll heard of him?&#8212;won
the &#8220;Plate&#8221; some thirty years back.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, his lady, Mrs. Dennington, was
just the proudest woman in the whole county
of Northumberland&#8212;scarcely what ye would
call &#8220;bonny,&#8221; but just tarr&#8217;ble handsome, and
the Squire, he fair worships her. He had
married her in Berlin, and there was some
queer odds an&#8217; ends o&#8217; stories about her, but
he&#8217;d never have hearkened to <a id="tn1">them</a> any more
than he would listen to anyone shoutin&#8217; to
him the way to go out hunting.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He was in the army at that time, ye ken&#8212;the
Northumberland Fusiliers, &#8220;The Old
and Bold,&#8221; with &#8220;Where the Fates calls ye&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in Latin for their motto&#8212;and I was his man-servant,
joining the army along of him, as my
forbears had often done with his forbears
beforetime.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The Squire had to go out to Berlin with
his mother, and he gets leave for me to
accompany him, and there it was that he
met with his lady that was to be&#8212;Miss
Maxwell as she was then.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;She was the handsomest woman in Berlin,
&#8217;twas said, but quite poor, living as a companion
with the wife of one of the Ambassador&#8217;s
party, being a kind of cousin, and
many were the stories about her.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Gossip said that one of them grand dukes
with a name a yard long had wanted her for
his mistress, but when he made his proposition
he got such an answer that he never
dared speak to her again. Then it was
reported that she was engaged to the Ambassador&#8217;s
chief secretary, Oxencourt his name
was&#8212;Sir Henry Oxencourt as he is now&#8212;and
that she had even run away with him, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that at the last moment he turned round and
said that he couldn&#8217;t afford to marry her till
his father died, so there and then she leaves
him, walks the night through till she can
get a conveyance, and arrives just in time to
stay the mouth of scandal from ruining her
reputation.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, the Squire meets her, falls desperately
into love&#8212;for he cares nothing for
gossips&#8212;and in three weeks&#8217; time she accepts
him for good and all.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;They marries at once, and travel for a
year or more, and finally settle down at
Dennington Hall.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The Squire after a bit sends for me, buys
my discharge, makes me his body-servant, and
sets up the old banqueting-room as a fencing
hall&#8212;for he was always tarr&#8217;ble keen at
fencing, boxing, single-stick, and all manly
sports&#8212;and it was part of my duty to give
them both a turn of fencing most mornings
of the week.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, one winter, after about three years
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of marriage, the Squire goes off to Algeria
to shoot gazelle, leaving Mrs. Dennington
and his sister behind at the Hall, and he
hadn&#8217;t been gone more than a week before
Sir Henry Oxencourt turns up at the Hall.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, when I see him there, I was fair
dismayed, for I kenned nicely there was but
one thing he could be wantin&#8217;, for his repute
in the matter of women was notorious. Forbye
that ancient gossip at Berlin had always
reported that he had been mad at missing
his chance with her, and had sworn he would
win her back again&#8212;get her a divorce and
marry her himself at the finish.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;His father had died since then, and he
was now a rich man, and as handsome and
masterful a man as ever I saw in my life.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, he comes and he courts her the
live-long day, quiet-like and respectful, but
never missing an opportunity, and she seems
to enjoy his company. They go out hunting
together; she dares him to jump this and he
dares her to jump that, and so the play goes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
on, and all the while I was fearing he was
getting a fast hold upon her, for she liked
power and was tarr&#8217;ble ambitious, and Sir
Henry, they said, might have been one of
the cleverest diplomatists in the world if he
could but have kept clear of women.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was easy to see that he was just mad
keen for her, but I was not so sure after a
bit that she was so keen for him. It seemed
to me she was leading him on, and leading
him on, but with what purpose I couldn&#8217;t
guess.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, one afternoon she comes to me and
she says, off-hand like, &#8220;Sir Henry Oxencourt
would like to show me some new tricks
of fence he has learnt abroad; kindly see that
the fencing-room is in order to-night, and,
by the way, I want to show him the pair of
duelling rapiers, with the silver foxes on the
hilts, that Mr. Dennington is so fond of.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, all afternoon I wondered what it
meant; for though her manner was cool
enough, there was something curious about
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
my mistress&#8217;s expression as she gave her
orders.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;If possible,&#8221; I thinks to myself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have
a peep also at Sir Henry&#8217;s tricks to-night,&#8221; and
as I polished up the rapiers that afternoon I
thought of the story the Squire used to tell
of them. One of them had a stain on the
&#8220;foible&#8221; which would not come out for any
quantity of rubbing&#8212;it was the blood, the
Squire said, of a certain &#8220;Black Rutherford,&#8221;
who had made love to the then Lady Dennington
when her Knight was away fighting
for King Charlie. Sir John comes back,
having heard about it, but says nothing, and
asks him to dinner; they have a game of
cards after; Sir John accuses him of cheating,
and there and then in the banqueting-hall
they have a set-to with their rapiers
before my lady&#8217;s eyes; in five minutes Sir
John disarms him, and before the rapier
touches the floor, runs him clean through the
right lung and out below the shoulder-blade.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, after taking in coffee that evening,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
I went to the fencing-room, and on the
pretence of looking after the fire, mending
jackets, straightening masks, and so forth,
stayed on there till about ten o&#8217;clock, when
in comes Mrs. Dennington, followed by Sir
Henry.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;She gives a sort of start when she sees
me, then she says curtly, &#8220;You needn&#8217;t stay,
Carruthers,&#8221; and walks past me into the
middle of the room.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, I felt bound to see that fencing,
whatever it might be, and the only way I
could manage it was to go round and up to
the old musicians&#8217; gallery at the southern
end. If I could open the door without
attracting notice, I might then lie down at
full length and see pretty well what was
going on below.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It took me the best part of five minutes
to open the door and squeeze through, and
when I had crawled to the ledge and looked
over, the two combatants were just about to
begin.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
&#8216;&#8220;Put the letters on the mantelpiece,&#8221; I
could hear her say with a curiously strung
tone to her voice, and Sir Henry bowed in
a mocking sort of way. Then he says
slowly, after having walked to the chimney-piece
and placed a packet on the shelf:
&#8220;But it is not quite fair, of course, for you
cannot see your stakes, whereas I&#8212;I have
mine before my eyes at the end of my blade&#8212;the
most beautiful stakes in Europe,&#8221; and
he bowed again to Madame with an air of
gallantry and passion and arrogance all in one.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;For reply the mistress only gave a quick
nod with her head, nervous, impatient, like a
racehorse that must be away.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I daren&#8217;t do more than peep over now
and again, for the lights were bright below,
and I was afraid of being caught; but I could
see that she was in a state of great excitement,
while he was cool in comparison with
her, and wore a proud, triumphing sort of
air, as of one who knows full well he has the
victory in his grasp.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
&#8216;They walk to the centre of the hall and
take their stands. They &#8220;take length,&#8221; and
then salute&#8212;she, swiftly, nervously, he in a
foreign, bravado sort of fashion.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;First blood,&#8221; says Sir Henry, &#8220;and the
stakes are won,&#8221; saluting once again in a
vainglorious way he had.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Yes, but not for a scratch,&#8221; replies my
lady swiftly. Then they cross rapiers, and
the play begins.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;My sangs! but it wasn&#8217;t a play at all, it
was a reg&#8217;ler battle, a fair duello, and it was
all Sir Henry could do to hold his own.
They had engaged in &#8220;quatre,&#8221; and no
sooner had blades touched than she disengages
and feints in &#8220;tierce&#8221;; then, with
an amazing swiftness, she disengages again,
and lunges full at him in &#8220;sixte&#8221;; carelessly
he parries with &#8220;sixte,&#8221; and in a flash she
disengages again, &#8220;beats&#8221; his blade downwards,
and, for all but a biscuit, has him
disarmed. He loses hold of his weapon,
his fingers slipping from the quillons, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
catches it in mid-air before it drops, leaps
back a yard, parrying another lunge clever
with his left hand as he does so.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;&#8217;Tis a dirty Italian trick ye have learnt!
they haven&#8217;t improved ye abroad!&#8221; my lady
sneers at him.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Now, had she been but one flash of an
eye quicker with her lunge after the &#8220;beat,&#8221;
she&#8217;d have had him in &#8220;quatre&#8221; nicely, but
she hadn&#8217;t thought she could disarm him so
easy, and she just missed her chance. Sir
Henry, though, had had his lesson; he drops
his careless, tempting manner, such as a
professor tries a beginner with, and fights
cooler and more careful, chucking his bravado
airs, for it&#8217;s dead in earnest she is, and no
mere stage-play for the gallery.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;On she comes again like a tigress, evidently
trying to &#8220;rush&#8221; him, and back and
back she presses him till the pair o&#8217; them&#8217;s
right under the gallery where I was lying.
I had my head right through the bars by
that time, I was so keen to see the fight,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and it was only by stuffing my handkerchief
into my mouth that I could stop myself from
shouting advice and encouragement to her,
she fought so desperate keen and with such
a wild-cat pluck.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It wasn&#8217;t exactly scientific, her fencing,
it was too rash and all-for-victory straight
away, but it was grand to see her flashing
her rapier in and out, flickering like a
serpent&#8217;s tongue, and all the while her
graceful limbs moved softly, swiftly, like a
panther&#8217;s, beneath her silken evening dress.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Once Sir Henry&#8217;s foot slipped, and in
she comes like a knife, and he only escapes
by adopting another Italian trick&#8212;that of
dropping with the left hand to the floor.
She still presses him harder than ever, and
I could hear her breathing hotly, &#8220;heck,
heck,&#8221; like an angered hawk. Then swift
he &#8220;binds&#8221; with her, but he does it over-viciously
and pays for it, for she&#8217;s agile as a
cat, and freeing herself with a leap backward,
suddenly with a lightning-like &#8220;cut-over&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
touches him on the sword arm, and though
he wouldn&#8217;t acknowledge it, I knew she&#8217;d
pricked him, and I could tell that it had
roused him to anger in his turn. &#8220;You
she-devil!&#8221; I heard him hiss between his
teeth, and now he turned to the offensive
himself.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He was at a disadvantage, though, for
he didn&#8217;t want to hurt her badly, being a
woman, so he tries to disarm her, and give
her some slight wound on the sword arm, or
high in &#8220;quatre&#8221; or &#8220;tierce.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;That was no good, as I could have told
him nicely, for she had the strongest and
supplest wrist of any woman ever I saw, and
forbye that, disarming can only be done by
taking your opponent unawares, and she
kenned nicely what he was after.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Then sudden he gies it up, seeing the
uselessness o&#8217;t, and tries a brute strength
game, waits his chance till he can lift up her
blade, and then thrusts sideways so as to
pink her high in the shoulder, but she twists
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
aside and it only just touches her through
the sleeve. &#8220;First blood!&#8221; he shouts
triumphantly, &#8220;the stakes are mine,&#8221; with
a low bow and a sweep o&#8217; the sword arm.
&#8220;Phit!&#8221; she cries passionately; &#8220;it&#8217;s only a
scratch,&#8221; and she comes again at him with a
bound.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Then he loses his temper a bit, I think,
for his own sword arm was bleeding, as I
knew well, for I saw a drop or two of blood
on the floor and his hand was crimson
forbye. So he comes to meet her, quickly
driving her back in turn, plying his rapier
this way and that fiercely, just missing her
by a hair&#8217;s breadth to frighten her, till he
could have her at his mercy, and then he
tries a &#8220;cut-over&#8221; in &#8220;tierce,&#8221; swift as a
meteor, pressing his &#8220;fort&#8221; strongly against
her &#8220;foible,&#8221; and would have been home
sure as fate had not his foot slipped on a
drop of blood on the floor. Up flies his
rapier idly&#8212;she with a sudden flip tosses it
higher still, and with a leap, by Gox! she
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
ran him through in &#8220;seconde&#8221;&#8212;just above
his right hip.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Hurroo!&#8221; shouts I, through my handkerchief
and all. &#8220;Clever, clever!&#8221; for it was
splendidly done&#8212;scientific, exact, just perfection.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There Sir Henry lay in a swoon upon
the floor, for no doubt the pain and the
shock together would be immense, while my
mistress, she just takes one look at him, then
wipes her rapier swift upon her handkerchief,
takes up Sir Henry&#8217;s also, and places them
against the rack in the armoury, takes down
two foils, throws one on the floor, breaks the
other in two and flings the pieces down
beside its fellow. Then swift as ever she
goes to the mantelpiece, takes up the bundle
of letters and chucks them into the fire.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;She watches them burn for a moment,
then presses the electric bell close by, and
just as John the footman walks in at the
door Sir Henry comes to himself, and lifts
himself up on to his elbow off the floor.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Help Sir Henry Oxencourt up to his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
room,&#8221; says she, cool as a cucumber, &#8220;and
tell Carruthers to attend to him, and to send
for the doctor, if necessary. A foil broke as
we fenced, and Sir Henry, I fear, has suffered
through the accident.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;John stares with an open mouth, but a
peremptory &#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand?&#8221; from
his mistress wakes him up, and he goes and
helps Sir Henry up, who therewith slowly
rises, and, resting one hand on John&#8217;s
shoulder, without one word limps away.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The door shuts, and Mistress Dennington
turns slowly to the fire, her eyes glued to
them letters burning blackly amongst the
coals. As she watches she takes a cigarette
from a box on the mantelshelf, lights it, and
I heard her say to herself, &#8220;You fool!&#8221; then
she smokes a puff or two and again she says,
&#8220;You fool!&#8221; and therewith taps her foot
smartly on the floor.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;But what do you think she meant by
&#8220;fool&#8221;?&#8217; I here interrupted.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well,&#8217; replied Jake slowly, &#8216;I&#8217;ve often
asked myself that very question, and what I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
believe she meant was something o&#8217; this
sort: &#8220;Fool not to take your chance&#8212;and
such a chance!&#8212;when you had it, and Fool
again, for not knowing me better than to
think that of me when &#8217;twas too late.&#8221;&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;And now one more question,&#8217; I said, for
Jake was preluding with his weapon once
again, evidently anxious to commence another
bout. &#8216;Did you ever tell the Squire?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;No, not exactly,&#8217; replied he, &#8216;but I gave
him a hint, and bank-notes wouldn&#8217;t have
bought that rapier after that, and there it
still hangs in Dennington Hall in the
armoury, I believe, though I haven&#8217;t been
there since the Squire died and I set up as
a Maître d&#8217;Armes in Oldcastle here. The
mistress, though, she&#8217;s still alive, but she
never cared for Northumberland&#8212;&#8220;so dull,&#8221;
says she, and goes and diverts herself in
London town. And now no more talk.
<span xml:lang="fr">Gardez-vous, M&#8217;sieur&#8212;en garde, s&#8217;il vous
plaît</span>,&#8217; and with a smile he struck my foil
upon the floor.
</p>

<p class="pagenum-h-p"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<h2>&#8216;T&#8217;OWD SQUIRE&#8217;</h2>

<p>
&#8216;No, I never saw him, not the old
Squire&#8212;&#8220;t&#8217;owd Squire,&#8221; as they
called him; but grandfather, he was thick
with him, bein&#8217; the oldest farmer in the dale
an&#8217; pretty nigh a gentleman hisself in those
days; he was master of the &#8217;ounds, d&#8217;ye see,
when they was a trencher-fed pack&#8212;that
was before Squire Heron took them over to
t&#8217; new kennels at The Ford.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, I done some pretty fair jumps
myself at one time an&#8217; another in t&#8217; ring or
steeple-chasin&#8217;, but &#8217;twas nowt to what he
done, not even when a mare I was ridin&#8217;
jumped over a wall an&#8217; fifteen feet into t&#8217;
quarry t&#8217; other side.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There&#8217;s a pretty tidy place at t&#8217; bottom o&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that field&#8217;&#8212;pointing to a low-lying, marshy
expanse on the left that rose at the end to a
high bank&#8212;&#8216;that he jumped one afternoon
in cold blood which five out of six wouldn&#8217;t
have touched in warm, but at t&#8217; end of his
time he was reckless&#8212;almost to touch on
madness, so grandfather always said. But if
ye&#8217;ll bide here three minutes till I&#8217;ve seen the
mare looked to properly I&#8217;ll tell ye a tale of
t&#8217; Squire&#8212;same as grandfather told it me.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
So saying Jack Skelton cantered round to
the farm, where he was now employed as
horse-breaker and showyard rider, while I
strolled down to view the leap at the end of
the field till he was free to join me. I could
see The Ford opposite to me as I walked
along&#8212;a square keep flanked with castellated
wings rising proudly amongst its trees
beyond the winding river in a circle of fir-clad
hills.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The old Squire&#8217;s&#8217; daughter lived there
now with her husband, who had taken her
name on his marriage, but they were childless,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and the ancient race of Herons seemed
destined to become extinct.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the bank I saw a formidable
gulf open below me, with a soft and rotten
landing on the further side, some fourteen
feet across, the space between oozy with
marsh mud and choked drains. &#8216;&#8220;All hope
abandon ye who enter here,&#8221;&#8217; I quoted
aloud, just as Jack Skelton came up to me.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay,&#8217; he chuckled, &#8216;it would be a job for
a contractor to get a horse an&#8217; man out o&#8217;
that, an&#8217; after that I&#8217;ll lay odds but the
laundry-maid would give her notice.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was a great big, seventeen hands horse
he had that he jumped it with&#8212;an ugly devil
to look at, light roan in colour, but up to any
weight an&#8217; absolutely fearless. All ye had
to do, as grandfather used to say, was to lay
t&#8217; reins on his neck, and straight across
country he&#8217;d go like a bird.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He hadn&#8217;t always been such a fierce one
to go, hadn&#8217;t t&#8217; Squire, and what changed his
temper was what I was goin&#8217; to tell ye.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
&#8216;There was a woman in it, d&#8217;ye see, an&#8217;
that woman his wife. When first they was
married no couple in broad Yorkshire was
happier, as folk thought. She was a handsome
lass and clever at book-larnin&#8217; an&#8217;
suchlike, ambitious, too, like the clever
ones usually are; but at first she was all for
sport an&#8217; huntin&#8217;, same as t&#8217;owd Squire, and
where he went she mostly followed him,
bein&#8217; as well mounted as himself. As for
t&#8217;owd Squire, he was t&#8217; happiest man alive in
those days&#8212;used to slap grandfather on t&#8217;
back an&#8217; cry, after a steaming run, t&#8217; fox&#8217;s
mask in his hand ready to tie on to his
missus&#8217;s saddle, &#8220;By &#8212;&#8212;, Skelton, but she&#8217;s
the straightest woman rider in England,
whether in or out o&#8217; t&#8217; shires.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Yet for all that his happiness was short-lived,
for after a son was born to him
Mistress Heron seemed to lose heart for
huntin&#8217;&#8212;her narves, she said, had gone
wrong with her; but grandfather always
upheld that she&#8217;d grown tired of her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
husband. She was a clever woman, as I
said, an&#8217; ambitious; an&#8217; &#8217;twas reported that
she&#8217;d been forced to marry wi&#8217; t&#8217;owd Squire
by her mother in Lunnon town&#8212;he bein&#8217; as
rich as &#8220;Creases&#8221;&#8212;whilst the man she
really favoured hadn&#8217;t a penny beyond what
his wits might bring him in. For a bit the
excitement of huntin&#8217; had been enough for
her, an&#8217; spendin&#8217; t&#8217; Squire&#8217;s brass, t&#8217; big
house, an&#8217; t&#8217; novelty; but after t&#8217; son was
born she grew dissatisfied an&#8217; took a dislike
to her life. Consequence was that she took
up with a young man called Cunliffe, that
lived over at The Tower&#8212;right away on
that hillside over there, about two miles
west of us&#8212;ye can see it against trees from
Heronsford easy.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The place had been bought by his father,
who made money in trade at Ironopolis, an&#8217;
he&#8217;d just got himself elected into Parliament,
an&#8217; was like to get on at it, &#8217;twas said, bein&#8217;
one of them ready-witted, oily-tongued chaps
that never go quite straight, but gallop along
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
t&#8217; roads an&#8217; sneak through gates, an&#8217; then
swagger on at t&#8217; kill. Ay, there&#8217;s none
&#8220;who-oops&#8221; an&#8217; &#8220;tally-hos&#8221; louder than
them.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;T&#8217;owd Squire, on t&#8217;other hand, was one
of t&#8217; owd-fashioned sort, and said what he
meant always, an&#8217; clapped an oath on t&#8217; back
of it; hated Lunnon, an&#8217; Lunnon ways, lived
for huntin&#8217; an&#8217; shootin&#8217; an&#8217; country pursuits,
an&#8217; drank a bottle of port wine reg&#8217;lar every
evenin&#8217; to his own cheek. He wasn&#8217;t over
well educated neither, havin&#8217; all his life lived
almost entirely at home; no scholar savin&#8217; a
vast knowledge of the stud-book, farriery,
an&#8217; horse-breedin&#8217;, which was a sort o&#8217; larnin&#8217;
that Mistress Heron didn&#8217;t care a button
about. Well, things went gradually askew
between the two, she always wantin&#8217; fresh
company in t&#8217; house, an&#8217; him hatin&#8217; society
ways like poison.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Amongst others she took up with was
this young Member o&#8217; Parliament, Cunliffe,
an&#8217; often he would be over an&#8217; dinin&#8217; with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
them; he could sing a bit, an&#8217; she was fond
of t&#8217; piano, an&#8217; they would play on together
in t&#8217; drawing-room while t&#8217; Squire sat over
his mahog&#8217;ny passin&#8217; t&#8217; bottle round, talkin&#8217;
over t&#8217; &#8217;untin&#8217;, layin&#8217; wagers with his own
particular cronies of the red-faced, good-hearted,
rough-tongued, fox-&#8217;untin&#8217; Yorkshire
style.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, t&#8217;owd Squire couldn&#8217;t stomach
young Cunliffe at all; for in the first place
he was a poor rider to &#8217;ounds, never jumped
owt if he could help it, was a mean chap
with his brass, an&#8217; had a supercilious way
o&#8217; talk about him that angered t&#8217; Squire
fearful. Add to this that he was always
comin&#8217; over to sweetheart his missus, an&#8217;
you can imagine how ill the two men would
agree.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, one night they was sitting playin&#8217;
cards after dinner, an&#8217; Mistress Heron was
lookin&#8217; on at them. T&#8217; Squire was nowt of
a scholar, as I said before, but he had a good
head for cards, an&#8217; loved to take t&#8217; shekels
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
off young Cunliffe, who hated losin&#8217;, but was
generally the one who had to pay up.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was a game they call Pickit they were
playin&#8217;; grandfather told me&#8212;for in after
days t&#8217; Squire let out a good bit of his
troubles to my grandfather, havin&#8217; been playmates
together, an&#8217; grandfather bein&#8217; a god-child
o&#8217; t&#8217;owd Squire&#8217;s father beside that&#8212;an&#8217;
Cunliffe bein&#8217; flustered had forgot when
it came to t&#8217; last two cards&#8212;there bein&#8217; a
ticklish bit at stake&#8212;what had been played
previously.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He looked this way and that, then all of
a sudden he catches Mistress Heron&#8217;s eye,
sees something in it that tells him somewhat,
claps doon t&#8217; right card an&#8217; wins.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;T&#8217;owd Squire, he keeps extraordinary
quiet, just gives one swift look round under
his eyelids at his wife standin&#8217; there above
him, an&#8217; says softly, &#8220;Ye&#8217;ve a wonderful
memory, Mr. Cunliffe,&#8221; says he, at which the
other gets very red, an&#8217; begins to talk of
getting home.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
&#8216;&#8220;Mistress Heron and I,&#8221; says t&#8217; Squire,
&#8220;were talking on this afternoon about t&#8217;
private steeplechase we&#8217;re going to hold
shortly in t&#8217; Park here, an&#8217; she was all for
layin&#8217; out t&#8217; course for first two miles straight
west till it almost touches Towers gates. &#8216;It
will just take inside of ten minutes from t&#8217;
Ford,&#8217; says she, &#8216;to Towers turn, and beautiful
going all the way over grass with t&#8217; big
jump an&#8217; t&#8217; black beck in t&#8217; middle of it.&#8217;
&#8216;Ay,&#8217; says I, &#8216;and that will stop one or
two that I know of&#8212;I&#8217;ll lay a monkey.&#8217;
&#8216;Not a bit of it,&#8217; says she, &#8216;not a bit; an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll take evens with ye that everybody
tries it.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Now, as Mistress Heron is going to
ask ye to ride one of her nominations for her
at the race, it might be helpful to ye to have
a preliminary trial, an&#8217; as t&#8217; night is bright as
day wi&#8217; moonlight, perhaps ye&#8217;d like a ride
home to-night across country, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll lay ye
double of what ye&#8217;ve won to-night that ye
don&#8217;t get to your own gate-ends in, say,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
twelve minutes from t&#8217; Ford&#8217;s paddock.
An&#8217; ye can have your pick o&#8217; what&#8217;s in my
stable,&#8221; adds t&#8217; Squire, as he looks from one
to t&#8217; other of them, &#8220;while Mistress Heron
an&#8217; I will watch ye from t&#8217; battlements an&#8217;
take time for ye; or, of course, if ye&#8217;re
afraid,&#8221; he adds, as Cunliffe, hemming an&#8217;
hawing, says something about &#8220;not likin&#8217; to
take a horse out at that time o&#8217; night,&#8221; an&#8217;
dwells heavy on the words, &#8220;we can send ye
home in the landau, like a lady,&#8221; says t&#8217;
Squire.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;If Mr. Cunliffe accepts your proposal to
ride a horse for me in the steeplechase,&#8221; interrupts
Mistress Heron scornfully, &#8220;that is
of itself sufficient to falsify your insinuation.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;I shall be only too proud,&#8221; cries Cunliffe
at once, with a bow, &#8220;to ride for Mistress
Heron.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Ay,&#8221; says t&#8217; Squire, &#8220;an&#8217; t&#8217; night before
a message will doubtless come to say that
Mr. Cunliffe has suddenly been called away
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
on important political business, an&#8217; he&#8217;s much
grieved to forego a pleasure he had been so
much looking forward to.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;You&#8217;ve said quite enough, sir,&#8221; cries
Cunliffe, red an&#8217; passionate; &#8220;kindly have
your horse saddled&#8212;t&#8217; light-roan one for
choice; for I take your wager an&#8217; will ride
your horse home this night.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;T&#8217; Squire goes out to t&#8217; stable himself,
gives his orders, an&#8217; in fifteen minutes&#8217; time
t&#8217; horse is round at t&#8217; door.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll be wantin&#8217; a switch likely,&#8221; says t&#8217;
Squire, as he shows him downstairs, &#8220;an&#8217; if
ye&#8217;ll come into t&#8217; gun-room here, ye can take
your pick o&#8217; crops, or cuttin&#8217; whips, or what
ye will.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;T&#8217; room was dark, an&#8217; Cunliffe, he bumps
up against a small pail o&#8217; something an&#8217; upsets
it on his trousers and all over t&#8217; floor before
t&#8217; Squire gets a candle lighted.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Never mind, never mind that,&#8221; says t&#8217;
Squire cheerily, &#8220;it&#8217;s just nowt to matter; it&#8217;s
just for to try my hounds with to-morrow, an&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
shouldn&#8217;t have been there. See, there&#8217;s
t&#8217; whip-stand; take your choice,&#8221; says he.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Cunliffe, he takes a cuttin&#8217; whip, an&#8217; jumps
on t&#8217; horse without more ado, an&#8217; goes out
into t&#8217; paddock with t&#8217; stud groom, who is
to show him where to start from when t&#8217;
Squire shouts &#8220;off&#8221; from the roof of the
house.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;A minute or two later t&#8217; Squire shows
himself on t&#8217; battlements, and Mistress
Heron&#8217;s there too, to see the sport.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Are ye ready?&#8221; rings out t&#8217; Squire&#8217;s
voice.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Yes,&#8221; comes back t&#8217; answer.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Then off!&#8221; he shouts down and drops t&#8217;
handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Away he goes at a full gallop straight
across t&#8217; wide-spreading west park-land,
then draws rein a moment as he approaches
t&#8217; haha with a drop of five feet or so,
perhaps. Just as he pulls up there comes a
faint &#8220;you-yowin&#8217;,&#8221; as of hounds upon a
scent, from around t&#8217; corner of t&#8217; house.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
&#8216;&#8220;Whatever&#8217;s that?&#8221; cries Mistress Heron
quickly, as she catches the sound of it.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s t&#8217; hounds,&#8221; cries t&#8217; Squire, with
a stabbing laugh. I thowt it might help
him t&#8217; jump t&#8217; black beck an&#8217; win his wager
to have t&#8217; hounds after him, an&#8217; so it will, for
there&#8217;s a bit aniseed sprinkled on Gamecock&#8217;s
fetlock bandages, an&#8217; Cunliffe&#8217;s stepped into
some himself.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;&#8217;Tis the deed of a savage!&#8221; says my
lady, and with a proud contempt of him she
steps away from his side as far as t&#8217; battlements
will permit.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Away go t&#8217; hounds wi&#8217; riotous music hot
upon t&#8217; scent; on, forrard on they go, right
over t&#8217; haha and up and across t&#8217; pasture
beyond, at t&#8217; end of which, and beside t&#8217;
beck, Cunliffe was galloping up an&#8217; down
trying to find an easier place. It appears
he hadn&#8217;t, in his excitement, taken notice of
t&#8217; hounds giving tongue, or looked behind
him, but all of a sudden he perceives it, and
halting his horse stockstill, looks behind him.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Then it seemed to flash upon him what&#8217;s up,
and he forces back t&#8217; horse some twenty yards
or so&#8212;first hounds racing towards him about
hundred yards behind&#8212;rams in t&#8217; spurs, cuts
him with t&#8217; whip, and claps him at it. Gamecock
tries it bravely, and leaping high into
the air just lands on t&#8217; further bank, but
short a bit, and on t&#8217; soft edge, and pecks
forward badly on his head, sending Cunliffe
somersaulting over like a shot rabbit.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;T&#8217; bet&#8217;s won!&#8221; shouts the Squire, marking
t&#8217; horse pick himself up before his rider and
gallop away by himself over t&#8217; far field; &#8220;t&#8217;
damned cockney cannot ride at all.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ve won your bet,&#8221; replies my
lady, gathering her skirts together and holding
them close as she passes him by, &#8220;but
possibly you may have lost remembrance that
you were born a gentleman,&#8221; and with that
she proudly turns her back and sweeps away
down t&#8217; stairs.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, t&#8217; hounds couldn&#8217;t get across t&#8217;
beck, and t&#8217; Squire&#8217;s first whip was ready
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
wi&#8217; t&#8217; horn to fetch them back again; so
Cunliffe was safe enough, but sorely damaged
an&#8217; bruised, an&#8217; &#8217;twas a full week before he
left his house, when straight he goes abroad
on foreign travel.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Things gradually went on from bad to
worse twixt t&#8217; Squire and Mistress Heron
after that night&#8217;s play; she used to lament
for Lunnon an&#8217; its fashions, an&#8217; on t&#8217; last
night of all she set t&#8217;owd Squire&#8217;s blood
blazin&#8217; by sneerin&#8217; at &#8220;country yokels&#8221; and
their drunken ways.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Why, damn t&#8217; &#8212;&#8212;!&#8221; cries he, quite
forgetting himself, and using a word more
suitable to t&#8217; kennels than t&#8217; drawing-room,
&#8220;ain&#8217;t we been here since King Alfred?
An&#8217; what can ye want more than that?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Swift as fire she answers him, &#8220;One
might wish that they were gentlemen,&#8221; says
she, an&#8217; cold an&#8217; contemptuous she walks past
him out of the drawing-room and up into her
own room, where she orders her maid to
pack up for her at once, an&#8217; &#8217;tis but an hour
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
later when she drives away in t&#8217; carriage an&#8217;
never sees t&#8217;owd place again.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, they separate by law, an&#8217; shortly
after, when t&#8217; bairn comes to live with his
father, Mistress Heron gets much taken up
with one of those father parsons, famous as
a preacher in Lunnon at that time.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Finally, she goes into a sort of retirement
and becomes head of a sisterhood shortly,
which gets to be very famous for its Good
Samaritan sort of deeds.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Grandfather used to say that whatever
she took up she would be sworn to do better
than anybody else. &#8220;Fox-&#8217;untin&#8217; she learnt
clever in six months&#8217; time, an&#8217; if ye can larn
that ye can larn owt,&#8221; says he.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;As for t&#8217;owd Squire, he hunts harder
than ever he had done before; an&#8217; nowt,
positively nowt, can stop him across country,
nor liquor stagger him, so that many
thought he was heartier an&#8217; happier than
ever he had been before.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;His son, as he grew up, was a bit trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to him, certainly, as he was a wild lad&#8212;just
like himself, but with a touch of his mother&#8217;s
pride, so that it was just as well when he
went into t&#8217; army an&#8217; was sent to t&#8217; Indies.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, time sped on, and t&#8217;owd Squire&#8217;s
hair was turnin&#8217; gray, when news came that
his wife&#8212;Sister Eva, as they called her&#8212;had
died suddenly in her retreat or convent.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Up goes t&#8217; Squire to Lunnon without a
word, an&#8217; when the chief mourners&#8212;all of
them ladies of t&#8217; sisterhood, in their white
dresses&#8212;were liftin&#8217; up t&#8217; coffin ropes to
carry it to t&#8217; graveside, an&#8217; ancient gentleman,
clad in a queer, long, bottle-green tail-coat,
with a high stock and beaver hat on t&#8217; back
of his head, comes forward an&#8217; quietly takes
hold of t&#8217; head ropes.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;T&#8217; sisters remonstrate with him, and ask
him who he is. &#8220;Mesdames,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I
was her unworthy husband,&#8221; and he doffs
his hat as he speaks, and without another
word spoken helps to carry her to her grave.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
&#8216;&#8217;Twas said that they were t&#8217; same clothes
he had worn on his wedding-day.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It would be some months after this that
my grandfather was dinin&#8217; with t&#8217;owd Squire,
after t&#8217; opening meet of t&#8217; season.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Here&#8217;s to fox-huntin&#8217;!&#8221; cries he, after
t&#8217; cloth was removed; an&#8217; a bit later he rises
solemnly in his chair, an&#8217; he says, &#8220;And here&#8217;s
to a saint in heaven!&#8221; an&#8217; as he drinks it down
grandfather sees a tear tricklin&#8217; on his cheek.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Little by little he tells him all about t&#8217;
quarrel and what had completed it: &#8220;And
she was right, by G&#8212;&#8212;!&#8221; cries t&#8217; Squire at
the end of it, &#8220;as she always was, though
I was too proud to say so then; and now
it&#8217;s too late, for she&#8217;s a saint in heaven.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;That was the only time he spoke of her;
but for all that, grandfather said it was clear
that he was just broken-hearted, was t&#8217; poor
owd Squire, even though five minutes after
he was challenging him to ride for a fiver
when &#8217;ounds should find on t&#8217; morrow&#8217;s
mornin&#8217;.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
&#8216;T&#8217;owd Squire never went better in his
life, they said, than he did that day; but just
at t&#8217; close of it his horse made a mistake
over some timber, and he came a cropper in
a ploughed field, with his horse on top of
him, and had three of his ribs broken.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was a baddish fall; but though the
doctors pulled him through he never got
the better of it, and was taken away before
t&#8217; season was out; and he was glad to go,
was poor owd Squire, for he said he believed
she had forgiven him, but he couldn&#8217;t rest
till he knew for certain.&#8217;

<h2>AN &#8216;AMMYTOOR&#8217; DETECTIVE</h2>

<p>
&#8216;Tell me about that mysterious affair
of &#8220;Tom the Scholar,&#8221; and Jack
Jefferson&#8217;s sudden death, and how you ran
him to ground when suspicion had given up
the chase. If all I have heard is true, you
ought to have been at Bow Street, high up
in the Criminal Investigation Department.
Tell me,&#8217; I said again, &#8216;how you came to
play the part of amateur detective.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was nowt o&#8217; the ammytoor aboot
it,&#8217; retorted &#8216;the Heckler&#8217; with aggressive
dignity, &#8216;it was a proper perfessional bit o&#8217;
wark, an&#8217; the pollis was fine put oot that they
hadn&#8217;t had a hand in it. Wey, there was
Scott, wor pollis; he came to us an&#8217; he says,
&#8220;If ye had only tell&#8217;t me about it I could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
hev made a job on &#8217;t,&#8221; says he, &#8220;&#8217;stead o&#8217;
lettin&#8217; him gan an&#8217; commit a fellor, d&#8217; y&#8217; see?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;No,&#8221; says I, &#8220;I divvn&#8217;t see; it was him
that done it, an&#8217; it was us as copped him, an&#8217;
if I hadn&#8217;t taken it intiv hand, wey, thoo
would have still been usin&#8217; long words an&#8217;
followin&#8217; up yor clue like an aad blind man
followin&#8217; efter his dog,&#8221; says I, &#8220;for I&#8217;ve no
sort o&#8217; notion o&#8217; the pollis; they nivvor finds
out nowt for themselves, ye hev elwis ti tell
them what it is ye want done, an&#8217; then at the
finish gan an&#8217; do it yorsel&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;No, no; the pollis is just what the lawyer
chaps call &#8220;accessories efter the fac&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;meanin&#8217;
they comes up ti ye when aal&#8217;s ower
an&#8217; done wi&#8217;, like the bairns at the school-sports,
each one expectin&#8217; a prize.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, as I was sayin&#8217;, I copped &#8220;Tom the
Scholar&#8221; aal maa lane, an&#8217; I doot whether
anyone else could hev done it but me. I
had suspected him a while back, for he was
a mistetched<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_4" href="#en_4">[4]</a></span> chap, ye ken, one o&#8217; the sort
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that has a bit grudge against everythin&#8217;, an&#8217;
vicious same as horses is sometimes, unforgettin&#8217;,
unforgivin&#8217;&#8212;just a nasty disagreeable
beggor, ye ken.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He was a scholar, though&#8212;&#8220;Tom the
Scholar&#8221; they called him&#8212;an&#8217; was aye busy
wi&#8217; books, nivvor had his head oot o&#8217; them,
whether at the Institute or at aad Mistress
Swan&#8217;s, where he lodged.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Efter a bit he takes up wi&#8217; courtin&#8217; Mary
Straughan, her who got married on Jack
Jefferson, an&#8217; I b&#8217;lieve she had a mind for
him once, but not for long, for he frightened
her biv his strange ways, an&#8217; a passionate
way o&#8217; talk he had, an&#8217; she gave up walkin&#8217;
wiv him an&#8217; took up wi&#8217; Jack instead&#8212;a
south-country chap that had come frae Yorkshire&#8212;a
big, burly, thick-headed sort o&#8217; chap,
but tarr&#8217;ble good-natured.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, Tom, he takes it varry badly, an&#8217;
just before they gets &#8220;called&#8221; i&#8217; church he
tarrifies Mary wi&#8217; vague threats as ti what&#8217;ll
happen if she dares ti wed wi&#8217; Jack. Noo,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Tom was a &#8220;spirritualist,&#8221; ye ken, as weel
as a scholar, an&#8217; he swears that the spirits
forbade the match, an&#8217; would be properly
savage if they was disobliged.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;She was a narvious sort, was Mary, an&#8217;
she tell&#8217;t Jack ov&#8217;t, an&#8217; Jack, he says, iv his
queer clipp&#8217;t Yorkshire way o&#8217; talk, &#8220;T&#8217;
spirrits be d&#8212;&#8212;d!&#8221; says he; &#8220;an&#8217; if that
softy Tom comes interferin&#8217; &#8217;twixt thoo an&#8217;
me, I&#8217;ll make him softier than ever,&#8221; he says,
shakin&#8217; a great big hairy fist that looked like
a bullock&#8217;s head.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, they gets theirsel&#8217;s married
wivoot askin&#8217; leave either o&#8217; the &#8220;spirrits&#8221;
or o&#8217; Tom, an&#8217; as nowt happened, an&#8217; Jack
forbye was tarr&#8217;ble lucky iv his cavils<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_5" href="#en_5">[5]</a></span> just
efter his marriage, even Mary began ti
laugh at the idea o&#8217; Tom an&#8217; his &#8220;spirrits&#8221;
an&#8217; aal.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
&#8216;They was tarr&#8217;ble happy those two, an&#8217; I
mind well hoo proud and triumphant-like
Jack looked as he slapped us on the back
one early summer mornin&#8217; as we went ti the
pit on the fore-shift, for I was only a hewer
then, same as himsel&#8217;, an&#8217; not what I is now&#8212;checkweighman,
an&#8217; half ov a magistrate
as well, bein&#8217; vice-chairman o&#8217; wor lokil
District Council<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_6" href="#en_6">[6]</a></span>&#8212;an&#8217; he cries, &#8220;Geordie,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;Geordie, man, I&#8217;s that happy I can
scarcely haud myself in. There&#8217;s nowt I
couldn&#8217;t do. I could hew as much in one
shift as any five men together in two; I
could lepp ower a hoos, I&#8217;s that cobby. I
could challenge wee Bob Aitchison, t&#8217;
sprinter, to a quarter-mile, an&#8217; lay t&#8217; fortnight&#8217;s
wages that I&#8217;d best him too. I could
sing, I b&#8217;lieve,&#8221; he says, an&#8217; wiv a solemn
voice on him he adds: &#8220;Ay, an&#8217; I could
even put up a bit prayer&#8212;though I&#8217;s not
much ov a Churchman&#8212;almost as weel as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
t&#8217; priest himself. An&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell thoo why.
It&#8217;s because Mary tells me that there&#8217;s likely
gawin&#8217; to be an addition to the fam&#8217;ly party
sometime shortly. She&#8217;s a rare well-bred un,
too, is Mary, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll lay it&#8217;s twins.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ll gie
ye the best o&#8217; luck,&#8221; says I, &#8220;but twins is
tarr&#8217;ble expensive, for I&#8217;ve tried &#8217;em,&#8221; says I.
&#8220;Man alive!&#8221; cries he, holdin&#8217; up his arm&#8212;a
proper colossyum ov a limb&#8212;&#8220;look at
that. If that cannot win bread for a dozen
o&#8217; twins, then a lighted candle cannot fire
gas,&#8221; says he.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He was a fine brave man,&#8217; continued &#8216;the
Heckler&#8217; slowly, &#8216;an&#8217; I can see him still
standin&#8217; on the heapstead, an&#8217; I mind hoo
pleased he was that he could hear a lark
singin&#8217; high i&#8217; the air ower heid just as the
sun peeped up before we went doon i&#8217; the
cage that mornin&#8217; for the last time together&#8212;just
as full o&#8217; life an&#8217; vigour he was as thoo
is noo&#8212;but for all that it was the last time I
saw him alive i&#8217; this world.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was the vary next mornin&#8217; that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
killed, but I wasn&#8217;t doon the pit that day, for
I had happened a bit accident the day before
through a shot that went wrang on us, an&#8217; I
was laid up i&#8217; bed for a week wiv a bandage
ower my eyes. I bear the marks yet,&#8217; and
he pointed to some small blue punctures, not
unlike shot marks, that the gunpowder had
left round about his left eyelid and cheekbone.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Aal I could hear was that he had been
knocked doon biv a runaway galloway pony
that a lad called Harry Nicholson used to
drive. Harry, ye must ken, was a bit weak
iv his intellectuals, hevin&#8217; been born iv an
ower great hurry like before his bit intellect
had had time ti ripen, through his mother&#8217;s
gettin&#8217; a gliff at an accident that had happened
her man doon the pit.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, Harry was a driver, as I said, an&#8217;
he an&#8217; the galloway was comin&#8217; doon an
incline wiv a full tub, an&#8217; the galloway, hevin&#8217;
bolted, dragged the tub off the lines, an&#8217; came
blindly tearin&#8217; along this side an&#8217; that smash
up inti Jack as he rounded an awkward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
corner. He was fearfu&#8217; knocked aboot when
he was picked up, they said, his head bashed
in bi the tub&#8217;s wheels, an&#8217; there he lay, dead
as mutton.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The crowner comes doon an&#8217; sits on the
body, an&#8217; the jury bring it in &#8220;Death by
mis&#8217;dventure&#8221; slap off, bein&#8217; iv a hurry likelies
ti get oot for their dinners, an&#8217; there the
whole thing would have ended wiv a buryin&#8217;
an&#8217; a gettin&#8217; up mevvies ov a bit subscription
fer his missus an&#8217; the bairn; ay, that&#8217;s hoo
it would have ended up had it not been for
&#8220;the Heckler.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I wasn&#8217;t allowed oot by the doctor, sae I
was just forced to think it oot aal maa lane&#8212;mevvies
havin&#8217; my eyes blindfolded helped
us a bit; anyways, I lay there quiet i&#8217; bed
an&#8217; found I could think it aal oot like Gladstone;
ay, an&#8217; I tell thoo that Gladstone
an&#8217; Horbert Spencor together cudn&#8217;t have
thought harder than I did at that period o&#8217;
time, nor have pieced the puzzle together
bettor than us. It sounds like a bit brag,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
mevvies, but it isn&#8217;t, by Gox! it&#8217;s just the
naked truth.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, there I lay between the sheets wi&#8217;
my &#8220;linin&#8217;s&#8221; on, detarmined that if there had
been any foul play nowt but death should
stop us frae findin&#8217; it oot. First thing I does
is ti get the wife ti ask Harry Nicholson in ti
tea wiv us, so as ti hear aal aboot hoo it
happened.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, efter he has been well filled oot wi&#8217;
tea, an&#8217; spice loaf, an&#8217; jam an&#8217; aal, I gets him
ti tell the whole story, an&#8217; then I axes him a
few supernumerary questions.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Thoo&#8217;ll ken &#8216;Tom the scholar?&#8217;&#8221; I axes
him&#8212;&#8220;him that&#8217;s a stoneman doon the pit,
an&#8217; gans in for spiritualism an&#8217; sich like for
his hobby an&#8217; pastime?&#8221; &#8220;Ay,&#8221; he says,
&#8220;I ken him nicely. Wey, I been at some
ov his &#8216;seeantics,&#8217; or whativvor it is he calls
them, an&#8217; I have the makin&#8217; ov a fine &#8216;meejum,&#8217;&#8221;
he says, &#8220;for I can parsonate folks ov
aal kinds, males an&#8217; females, wivoot any distinction
o&#8217; sexes.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
&#8216;&#8220;Ay!&#8221; says I, interruptin&#8217; him wiv a sort
ov admirin&#8217; surprise i&#8217; my tone o&#8217; voice, &#8220;can
thoo, noo? Wey, thoo&#8217;s a clivvor one, that&#8217;s
what thoo is.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Ay,&#8221; says he, quite enlarged at the
thought, &#8220;an&#8217; there&#8217;s some folk says that I
isn&#8217;t quite right i&#8217; the head, but they couldn&#8217;t
parsonate Alexander the Great&#8212;him that
the sword-dancers sing aboot&#8212;like as I can.
Could they, noo?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;No,&#8221; says I, &#8220;not they. They&#8217;re not
scholars enough for that, an&#8217; mevvies they
would be gliffed at it as weel. Dis thoo
nivvor get a gliff at the spirits?&#8221; I axes,
careless like.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Not while I&#8217;s parsonating, I divvn&#8217;t,
but whiles when I&#8217;s doon the pit I gets a
gliff,&#8221; says he; &#8220;it&#8217;s sae dark an&#8217; lonesome i&#8217;
places.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Dis Tom ivvor try to make thoo parsonate
doon i&#8217; the pit?&#8221; I axes him, &#8220;for
Tom, bein&#8217; stoneman, &#8217;ll come across thoo at
times drivin&#8217; yor galloway.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
&#8216;&#8220;Ay, I&#8217;ve seen him doon below,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;though he nivvor talked on aboot
parsonating, but usuallies passes us by
wivoot sayin&#8217; nowt, for Tom&#8217;s a vary distant
sort o&#8217; chap, thoo knaas.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;But sometimes mevvies he would speak
wi&#8217; thoo when he passed thoo, an&#8217; other folks
wasn&#8217;t aboot? Did he ivvor talk on aboot
the spirits ti thoo at all? That day the
galloway ran away, did he speak wi&#8217; thoo
that mornin&#8217;? Mevvies he did, laddie, an&#8217;
mevvies he told thoo not ti speak aboot it
lest the spirits wouldn&#8217;t like it, or some
such kind ov argument,&#8221; says I, insinuatin&#8217;
it tiv him like one o&#8217; thae lawyer chaps iv
a wig.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Ay, he spoke tiv us that mornin&#8217;, sure
enough, sayin&#8217; as hoo he thought the spirits
was vexed, for he had heard them callin&#8217; i&#8217;
the pit itself through the darkness, an&#8217; he
wanted ti knaa whether I had heard the
voices same as himself or not. Well, I
hadn&#8217;t heard nowt, nor had nivvor thought
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
aboot spirits bein&#8217; doon the pit, but I gets a
bit gliffed myself at that, an&#8217; a bit later I
ackshally heard them speakin&#8217; aloud&#8212;sure
an&#8217; certain,&#8221; says he.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Did they gliff thoo just before the
galloway ran away an&#8217; ran ower poor Jack
Jefferson?&#8221; says I.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Ay,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I got a gliff then, for I
heard the spirits&#8217; voices shootin&#8217;<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_7" href="#en_7">[7]</a></span> oot against
us.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Gox!&#8221; says I, &#8220;to think o&#8217; that, noo!
Wey, thoo gies us a gliff an&#8217; aal; an&#8217; what
dis thoo hear them sayin&#8217;?&#8221; axes I.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;&#8216;Here&#8217;s the parsonator,&#8217; they shoots
out aloud, &#8216;that calls us frae wor rest. Lepp
oot upon him, an&#8217; torment him! At him,
Annexo!&#8217; or some such ootlandish name,&#8212;&#8216;at
him, spirits aal!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Sae thoo starts awa&#8217; likelies wi&#8217; the
galloway at a gallop, an&#8217; couldn&#8217;t get him
stopped on the incline?&#8221; I axes him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
&#8216;&#8220;No, no, I was ower flay&#8217;d mysel&#8217; ti do
owt; but the galloway must have gotten a gliff
at something. I mind I thought I saw a flash
o&#8217; light just at the moment, an&#8217; the galloway
he couldn&#8217;t abide a sudden light across his
eyes, he was that narvious; or mevvies it
was the voice that gliffed him same as it did
us; anyways, awa&#8217; aff he goes wivvoot me,
an&#8217; dashes aff doon the incline wiv us chasin&#8217;
him an&#8217; shootin&#8217;, &#8216;Woa, woo-h, Paddie;
woo-ah, thoo daftie!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;An&#8217; hoo far behind him dis thoo think
thoo was when he come to the corner where
he ran inti poor Jack? Did thoo see Jack
theesel&#8217;, or hear him shoot out as the
galloway butted him?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;No,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I nivvor seen him, an&#8217;
I wasn&#8217;t far behind the galloway nowther,
for as soon as the tub got awa&#8217; frae the lines
he couldn&#8217;t travel vary fast, for it was loaded.
Aal I could hear was the bumpity-bump o&#8217;
the tub, then smash inti the wall&#8212;smash&#8212;smash&#8212;an&#8217;
a crash as the tub swung ower
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
an&#8217; dragged the galloway wiv it. I can mind
nae mair nor that, mistor,&#8221; says he, at the
end ov his tale, &#8220;for I fell slap ower Jack
Jefferson&#8217;s body i&#8217; the darkness, an&#8217; pitchin&#8217;
full upon my head was knocked senseless, till
they come along an&#8217; picked us up. An&#8217; that&#8217;s
the whole story, Mister Carnaby,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;an&#8217; I&#8217;ve done wi&#8217; the spirits, an&#8217; parsonatin&#8217;,
an&#8217; aal noo, for they&#8217;re treacherous
things, there&#8217;s nae doot aboot it,&#8221; says he.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Weel, that was aal I could get oot ov
him, sae I gives him some sweeties an&#8217; lets
him gan, biddin&#8217; him not let on that I&#8217;d axed
him any questions, ye ken, an&#8217; efter that I
lay i&#8217; bed thinkin&#8217; it aal ower an&#8217; makin&#8217; up
a plan o&#8217; campaign for when &#8220;the Heckler&#8221;
should be up an&#8217; aboot again.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Efter aboot another three days I was
allowed oot by the doctor wiv a sort o&#8217; lampshade
ower my eyelids, an&#8217; the next day bein&#8217;
&#8220;pay Saturday,&#8221; an&#8217; the pit idle, I detarmines
within my ain mind ti gan doon maa lane an&#8217;
hev a look round by myself; for it&#8217;s no use
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
trustin&#8217; anyone else when ye&#8217;ve got a job o&#8217;
that calibry iv hand, ye ken.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I kenned where the trajiddy had taken
place, o&#8217; course, sae I detarmines ti gan ti
the spot an&#8217; make a sarious of obsarvations.
&#8220;First place,&#8221; I says ti myself, &#8220;there winnot
be much change i&#8217; the surroundin&#8217;s, for it&#8217;s
a new drift in by there that they are drivin&#8217;,
wi&#8217; &#8216;Tom the Scholar&#8217; an&#8217; his marrow, an&#8217;
not many workin&#8217;; an&#8217;, secondly, it&#8217;s damp
there wi&#8217; the salt water oozin&#8217; in through the
rock, sae that footmarks will have a good
chance ti stand a bit.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Noo, &#8220;Scholar Tom&#8221; had a tarr&#8217;ble large
footprint, ye ken, an&#8217; it was that I was i&#8217;
search o&#8217;, for I had my suspicions o&#8217; what
might have happened, an&#8217; I was convinced
that that d&#8212;&#8212;d, mistetched beggor was at
the bottom o&#8217; poor Jack Jefferson&#8217;s sudden
endin&#8217;&#8212;ay, an&#8217; whenivvor I thought o&#8217; that
fine, brave chap an&#8217; his bright face an&#8217; his
happiness, I says ti myself, &#8220;There&#8217;ll be no
rest nor pleasure nor nowt for &#8216;the Heckler&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
till the mystery&#8217;s discovered; an&#8217; it&#8217;s yor job
ti discover it,&#8221; I says ti myself.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He was bound ti have been there, for,
o&#8217; course, it was him as shooted out that
nonsense at Harry that had gliffed him, an&#8217;
dootless it was him that had flashed his
davy i&#8217; the galloway&#8217;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Jack, d&#8217;ye see, would have been lousin&#8217;
off frae his wark an&#8217; walkin&#8217; doon the drift
at that time when the galloway started off;
but what beat me was that Jack couldn&#8217;t hev
got oot o&#8217; the way i&#8217; time, bein&#8217; fine an&#8217;
active, grand at hearin&#8217; and seein&#8217;, an&#8217; ne
fool forbye that.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Noo, just when I had detarmined upon
this i&#8217; maa mind a sort ov an inspiration
takes us aal ov a sudden. &#8220;Wey divvn&#8217;t
thoo take that driver lad alang wi&#8217; thoo ti
show thoo exactly where the trajiddy happened?&#8221;
it says tiv us just as thoo it was
a real, genu-ine voice i&#8217; my inside. &#8220;Sink
me!&#8221; thinks I, &#8220;it&#8217;s a tarr&#8217;ble clivvor idea,
an&#8217; sae I will.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
&#8216;&#8220;Has thoo anything else ti add ti that,
Inspiration?&#8221; I axes it, an&#8217; shortlies efter it
says, &#8220;Divvn&#8217;t thoo trust ower much ti what
Nicholson says, nor tell him o&#8217; yor plan
beforehand, for he&#8217;s i&#8217; Tom&#8217;s power, an&#8217;
tarrified ov him,&#8221; it says again.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Gox!&#8221; thinks I, &#8220;but this is the
champion; wey, I&#8217;s as good a spiritualist
as Tom himself.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;There&#8217;s one last question I must ax
thoo,&#8221; says I, for I hadn&#8217;t properly thought
beforehand o&#8217; the difficulty o&#8217; gannin&#8217; doon
the pit on &#8220;pay-Saturday,&#8221; an&#8217; that is: &#8220;Hoo
i&#8217; the warld can us gan in-bye? for thoo
kens that naebody but the furnace-man,
engine-man, an&#8217; horse-keeper gans doon that
day, an&#8217; if anyone else wanted ti, wey, he
would have ti get leave frae the manager, an&#8217;
even then he would have ti have a deputy alang
wiv him. Answer us this, Inspiration,&#8221; says
I, &#8220;an&#8217; it&#8217;s a clagger for thoo, I&#8217;s warned.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;But, mevvies efter two minutes, it whispers
back two words, &#8220;drift,&#8221; an&#8217; &#8220;beer.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
&#8216;&#8220;Drift?&#8221; I repeats, an&#8217; &#8220;beer?&#8221; An&#8217;
then aal at onst I sees the implication, for
I kenned the lodge-keeper at the head o&#8217;
the drift nicelies, an&#8217;, what&#8217;s mair, I kenned
what Sammy Cuthbertson, the local preacher,
calls &#8220;the joint iv his harness&#8221; still better.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Sae I gans up tiv him quietly, an&#8217; I says
tiv him, &#8220;Geordy,&#8221; says I, &#8220;hoo much o&#8217;
the best beer will five bob procure iv an
emergency?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Five bob,&#8221; says he, vary serious, &#8220;will
buy aal but two gallons o&#8217; the best bitter,
an&#8217; d&#8212;&#8212; the emergency,&#8221; says he.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Dis thoo prefer it i&#8217; bottles, or iv a
greyhen, or iv a pail&#8212;an&#8217; aal at onst?&#8221; says I.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Bottles is no use,&#8221; says he, &#8216;wey, the
corks alone will mevvies take a pint ti theirselves.
Na, na, gie it ti me iv a pail for aal-roond
drinkin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Well,&#8221; says I, &#8220;thoo shall have it iv a
pail if thoo&#8217;ll just let us an&#8217; the lad here gan
in doon by the drift for an hour ti investigate
a private matter o&#8217; wor ain&#8212;just a visit ov
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
inspection. No harm done, nobody need
ken, an&#8217; up again within the hour, I&#8217;ll promise
thoo that,&#8221; says I.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, his face prolonged itself at that a
bit. &#8220;But if it was kenned,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I&#8217;d
get my notice.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Nobody will ken but us three,&#8221; says I;
&#8220;an&#8217;, look thoo, thoo shall have the pail at
yor dinner to-morrow forenoon,&#8221; says I.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;That did the business for him, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d,
an&#8217; he promises ti oot wiv his key an&#8217; let us
gan in by. Poor chap, though, he got his
notice aal the same, though it wasn&#8217;t my
blame: it was because he was ower-greedy
an&#8217; thought he could get another pailful oot
o&#8217; somebody else later.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, I says nowt ti Nicholson aboot
gannin&#8217; doon the pit till the vary mornin&#8217;,
and then I gans along an&#8217; catches ahaud on
him, an&#8217; says, &#8220;Ho-way,<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_8" href="#en_8">[8]</a></span> thoo mun come
along wiv us doon the pit, for I wants ti see
the place o&#8217; the accident myself, an&#8217; I hev
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
arranged aboot gannin&#8217; doon,&#8221; I says. Well,
he turns quite white at this, an&#8217; whines an&#8217;
cries not ti gan; but I was res&#8217;lute wiv him,
an&#8217; tarr&#8217;fies him wiv a hint ov a gaol if he
winnot come doon and show us aal I axes him.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, we went by the drift and straight
doon ti the &#8220;Number 3, North,&#8221; or &#8220;Joan&#8221;
district, as we call it worsels, an&#8217; there we
gropes aboot the trolley-way, just at the
corner where the accident must have taken
place, an&#8217; searched for footmarks.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The lad, ye ken, must just have started
frae the putter&#8217;s flat wiv a full tub, an&#8217; aboot
thirty yards doon he must have been gliffed.
Hereaboots, iv a fenced place, Tom must
have waited on Jack&#8217;s &#8220;loosin&#8217; off&#8221; frae his
wark, an&#8217; another ten yards further on is
where the galloway must have run awa&#8217; off
frae the rails. I had it aal mapped oot ready
i&#8217; my mind, an&#8217; it was just the details I had
ti fit in wiv it.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was mair tramplin&#8217; aboot than I had
expected, what wi&#8217; the galloway&#8217;s stumblin&#8217;,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the tub ploughin&#8217; alang through the dirt, an&#8217;
the footprints o&#8217; the search-party that had
come up ti the scene o&#8217; the casualty; but for
aal that, I could see here an&#8217; there the marks
o&#8217; Tom&#8217;s big shoes, wi&#8217; the extry broad
plates at heel an&#8217; toes he used ti wear.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Mevvies it wasn&#8217;t ower much ti see, but
it heartened us up, for it conformed us i&#8217; wor
opinions, especially the fact that wherever
they was visible they was close in by the
wall-side, as if he had been wishful ti hide
himself as far as might be&#8212;a sort o&#8217; presumptuous
evidence against him, as the
lawyers call it.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;I will have ti gan back ti bed again,&#8221;
I says ti myself, &#8220;ti think it aal oot properly,
for though I haven&#8217;t a doot about it myself,
I&#8217;ll have ti convince aal thae thick-heads o&#8217;
judges at my lord&#8217;s &#8217;Size<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_9" href="#en_9">[9]</a></span> before I gets him
properly convicted, sae I must have it aal
pieced oot an&#8217; put together like a bairn&#8217;s
puzzle-map.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
&#8216;Well, we was slowly makin&#8217; wor way oot
o&#8217; the passage when I hears something
comin&#8217; up-by, creak, creakin&#8217; as it came.
Weel, I&#8217;s no coward, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll face
any man livin&#8217; that ye like ti mention, but I
got a fair gliff at that, for I couldn&#8217;t make
oot what it might mean&#8212;Nicholson an&#8217; us
bein&#8217; the only folk aboot doon there. &#8220;Gox,
it&#8217;s Jack&#8217;s ghost!&#8221; think I ti mysel iv a
sudden sweat o&#8217; fear. Sae oot at once I
turns my davy (lamp), an&#8217; the lad&#8217;s, fearin&#8217;
lest he might notice us, an&#8217; shrinks back inti
the corner o&#8217; the wall as small as could be,
with the lad tremblin&#8217; aal ower next us.
Efter a bit I sees a wee glimmer o&#8217; light
shakin&#8217; i&#8217; the darkness, then a shadow ov a
man behind it, an&#8217; slowly, vary slowly, as if
seekin&#8217; something, it mounts up the passage
towards us.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Hist!&#8221; says I ti the lad iv a thick
whisper, &#8220;just smear your face an&#8217; hands
ower wi&#8217; clarts, or the ghaist will cop us,&#8221; I
says, an&#8217; grabbin&#8217; a handful I clarts his face
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
an&#8217; hands iv an instant o&#8217; time; then I
scrapes up a handful for mysel&#8217; an&#8217; aal, but i&#8217;
reachin&#8217; oot for a good fill o&#8217; clarts my
hands struck up against a sort ov a heavy
bar o&#8217; some specie or other.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I gied a bit haul at it, an&#8217; awa it comes
up inti my hands&#8212;a small, heavy, but handy
bit ov iron it was, mevvies about sixteen
inches long, wiv a sort o&#8217; knob at the end o&#8217;t.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a look at thoo later,&#8221; says I,
an&#8217; claps it inti my pocket wi&#8217; the one hand,
whiles I clarts my face wi&#8217; the other. Meantime
the creakin&#8217; thing was drawin&#8217; nigher
an&#8217; nigher tiv us, but the light wiv it was
tarr&#8217;ble dim, an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t have given it a
name.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;On came the light an&#8217; the shadow, but
the creakin&#8217; noise had stopped; &#8217;stead o&#8217; that
there was a squelch, squelch, as ov a man
steppin&#8217; in an&#8217; oot&#8217; o&#8217; mud.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It passed us biv a finger&#8217;s breadth, an&#8217; I
almost shouted aloud by way o&#8217; relief, for it
was a real live flesh-an&#8217;-blood man, wiv a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
fouled davy, an&#8217; no ghost&#8212;for ghosts canna
spit, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;D&#8212;&#8212; thoo!&#8221; I was just aboot ti shoot
at him, comin&#8217; flayin&#8217; folk i&#8217; that fashion.
&#8220;Who is thoo, thoo &#8212;&#8212;&#8221; when he stops short
on a sudden, just round the corner above us,
an&#8217; talks tiv himself oot loud. &#8220;Ay, it&#8217;ll be
just aboot here,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;that it fell,&#8221;
and I could have let flee a yell o&#8217; delight that
would have brought a fall o&#8217; stone doon, for
it was no other voice than &#8220;Tom the
Scholar&#8217;s&#8221; himsel&#8217;.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Thoo b&#8212;&#8212;!&#8221; I says ti mysel&#8217;, an&#8217;
clenches my fist tight; &#8220;thoo b&#8212;&#8212;! but
I&#8217;s copped thoo noo.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Tell ti me noo, Annexo,&#8221; continues
Tom, usin&#8217; the same furrin&#8217; sort o&#8217; talk as he
had ti the lad; &#8220;tell ti me noo where it lies&#8212;the
weapon that freed my destined bride
frae unlawful arms. I mun hev it back, for
there&#8217;s a d&#8212;&#8212;d chap i&#8217; wor village that
they call &#8216;the Heckler,&#8217;&#8221; he gans on, the
impittent scoondrel that he was, &#8220;a daft feller
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
that&#8217;s mad aboot dogs an&#8217; sic&#8217; like nonsense,
but he has his suspicions, an&#8217; mevvies might
be dangerous, for he has been questionin&#8217;
my meejum, Nicholson, the driver lad.
Speak then, Annexo, speak, my beauty.
Where lies my trusty weapon? Speak
louder,&#8221; says he again, impatient like, &#8220;for I
canna hear i&#8217; the darkness.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Just on that instant I gets another
inspiration i&#8217; my insides, an&#8217; wivvoot mair
ado I whispers oot loud iv a fine, feminine,
and superfluous voice: &#8220;Search ti the right
hand a bit lower doon, canny man,&#8221; says I,
&#8220;an&#8217; thoo&#8217;ll find what thoo is wantin&#8217;,&#8221; an&#8217; I
held oot my hand ready ti grasp his wi&#8217; when
he stretched it oot.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Aha!&#8221; says he, quite gratified like, &#8220;sae
thoo has found a voice, has thoo?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was nigh pitch darkness about us, for
his davy had almost gane clean oot wi&#8217; the
clogged wick, but I could feel his hands
gropin&#8217; towards us, an&#8217; I says ti mysel&#8217;,
&#8220;Another foot, an&#8217; a murderer&#8217;s copped!&#8221;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
&#8216;His hands came hoverin&#8217; ower mine, for I
could feel the wind o&#8217; them; in another
second he touches us, an&#8217;, grabbin&#8217; ahaud ov
him by way o&#8217; reply, I shouts oot, &#8220;Ay,
here&#8217;s Annex-us, thoo b&#8212;&#8212;!&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The yell he let oot was fearfu&#8217;, an&#8217;, startin&#8217;
back, he dragged his arm oot o&#8217; my grasp,
an&#8217; then leaped forward iv a flash, ducked
past us, an&#8217; awa off round the corner he fled,
us efter him like the aad bitch<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_10" href="#en_10">[10]</a></span> efter a
started hare.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He had dropped his lamp, an&#8217; it was
darker nor Hell itself, but I could hear him
dashin&#8217; along i&#8217; front ov us at wondrous
speed. Mad keen I was, as I tore efter him
ower bits o&#8217; balk an&#8217; stone lyin&#8217; aboot doon
the rolley-way, bended double sae as ti avoid
the roof-beams. Bang up against a door I
comes, shakin&#8217; mysel&#8217; intiv a jelly by the
shock, but when I had it opened an&#8217; was
through I could still catch the sound ov his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
footfalls not far in front ov us. &#8220;He&#8217;ll have
come a big bat hissel&#8217; against the door,&#8221; I
thinks ti mysel&#8217; as I started off again, &#8220;ay,
an&#8217; bein&#8217; before us he&#8217;ll have aal the obstacles
ti contend wi&#8217; first ov aal. Huzza, ho-way!&#8221;
an&#8217; I tore efter him, a fair deevil for recklessness&#8212;makin&#8217;
no doot he was for the main
rolleyway, an&#8217; sae oot by the main drift by
which we had entered the pit.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There came the thud ov another door, an&#8217;
I gans a bit mair cautious like, fendin&#8217; wi&#8217;
my hands i&#8217; front ov us. Shortlies efter I
notices that the footfalls sounded fainter-like;
they seemed ti be comin&#8217; frae the left-hand
side noo an&#8217; not i&#8217; front ov us.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Aal ov a sudden I minds mysel&#8217; ov a
return air-way that would lead oot by the
main drift. &#8220;Gox!&#8221; I thinks, &#8220;thoo&#8217;s hit the
mark, but where the openin&#8217; is I cannot
mind, for it isn&#8217;t travelled biv any one
barrin&#8217; the deputies. He passed the door
i&#8217; front ov us, but bi the sound he&#8217;s ti
the left hand ov us noo;&#8221; sae I felt
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
along the wall till I comes tiv an open
way. &#8220;Ho-way,&#8221; says I, mad ti think he
might escape us efter aal, &#8220;ho-way, thoo&#8217;ll
get him yet!&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;On, on I went at a reckless speed, ti make
up for my bad turn, an&#8217; iv another minute I
gied tongue like a foxhound, for I heard
him pat, pattin&#8217; on i&#8217; front ov us. &#8220;I&#8217;s
copped thoo!&#8221; I yelled through the darkness
tiv him, ti tarr&#8217;fy him, for I heard him
stumblin&#8217; amangst some loose props or gear
o&#8217; some sort quite plainly, &#8220;I&#8217;s copped the
murderer!&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Foot upon foot I gains on him; I hears
him pantin&#8217; just a yard or two i&#8217; front ov us.
I grasps oot wi&#8217; my hands an&#8217; touches his
shoulder, an&#8217; he yells wi&#8217; terror, givin&#8217; a leap
like a hare, an&#8217; slips frae under my hands.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Doon, full length, doon I fell wiv a smash
like a fall o&#8217; stone, half stunned, my head
like a night o&#8217; stars.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Suddenly there comes a yell o&#8217; horror&#8212;then
a thud, a clump, clump, an&#8217; a c-clush,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
an&#8217; then stark silence, an&#8217; doon, right doon
at the bottom ov a staple fifteen fathoms
deep ten yards i&#8217; front ov us lay aal that
was left o&#8217; the murderer copped, clean copped,
by &#8220;the Heckler.&#8221;&#8217;
</p>

<p class="pagenum-h-p"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<h2>&#8216;IN MEMORIOV&#8217;M&#8217;</h2>

<p>
&#8216;Ay, that&#8217;s what &#8217;tis,&#8217; replied &#8216;the Heckler&#8217;
to my query, &#8216;it&#8217;s an &#8220;in memoriov&#8217;m&#8221;&#8212;Latin,
ye ken, meanin&#8217; in memory ov him.
The words is alike, mevvies, but it&#8217;s Latin
language, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d, an&#8217; I howked it oot
upon that headstone myself wiv a clasp-knife.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
I knelt down upon the sandy dune and
brushed aside the bents that nearly covered
the squat gray stone with their long lashes,
and eventually deciphered a straggling array
of figures which for their illegibility would
have enraptured an antiquary.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was just below us,&#8217; continued &#8216;the
Heckler,&#8217; &#8216;that I found his cap, an&#8217; thinkin&#8217;
him drooned, an&#8217; him bein&#8217; a favour-yte wi&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
me, I just put up that bit stone for him an&#8217;
carved his initials on it, an&#8217; the Latin, an&#8217;
G. C., that&#8217;s for us, &#8220;the Heckler,&#8221; ye ken,
his mark. But it was a false alarm efter aal,
an&#8217; noo that Jim Hedley&#8217;s a Right Hon.
Lord Mayor oot iv Australie, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d but
when he&#8217;s put under the sod he&#8217;ll hev a
hearse an&#8217; four horses an&#8217; a proper musulyum&#8217; (mausoleum) &#8216;tiv hisself.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;What made you think he was drowned?&#8217;
I inquired. &#8216;Did you think it a case of
suicide?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay, o&#8217; course I did; we aal did that,
an&#8217; not wivvoot reasons,&#8217; responded &#8216;the
Heckler,&#8217; &#8216;for he was full o&#8217; misery at that
time, an&#8217; wanted ti get shot o&#8217; the whole lot
ov it. Jim was a fine, tall, proper lad&#8212;&#8220;bonny
Jim&#8221; the lasses called him&#8212;wunnerfu&#8217;
handy, too, iv aal sorts of ways, an&#8217; as
for behaviour, wey, he could talk ti my lord
as canny as tiv a pot-boy.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, wiv aal these gifts o&#8217; fortune it
wasn&#8217;t surprisin&#8217; he got hisself sweetheartin&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
wiv a young, bonny, quiet-faced lassie,
daughter ov aad Sheepshanks, the farmer,
close in by the village.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was a bit lift for Jim, for she had some
brass, but aad Sheepshanks, he tries to forbid
the &#8220;callins&#8221;&#8217; (banns) &#8216;i&#8217; church; &#8220;for what&#8217;s
a pitman,&#8221; says he, &#8220;that a farmer&#8217;s daughter
should marry on?&#8212;a dirty-faced, drunken,
dog-lovin&#8217;, gamblin&#8217; chep,&#8221; says he; an&#8217; a lot
o&#8217; gob o&#8217; that kind, ye ken, bein&#8217; a red-hot
Tory wiv a lot o&#8217; Noah&#8217;s-ark kind ov ideas
iv his head.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The lassie didn&#8217;t think that, though; she
just warshipped Jim, followin&#8217; him aboot wiv
her eyes everywhere, just like the aad bitch&#8217;
(here he nodded towards the greyhound
beside him) &#8216;does &#8220;the Heckler.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, they marries an&#8217; has a bit fam&#8217;ly,
an&#8217; Jim gans ahead quick; he was marrow&#8217;
(mate) &#8216;wi&#8217; me as a hewer yence, an&#8217; then he
becomes a deputy, an&#8217; bein&#8217; a great reader
an&#8217; a gran&#8217; speaker, there was some talk o&#8217;
makin&#8217; him wor Member o&#8217; Parlyment when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
he got a bit older. Well, it had aal been
plain sailin&#8217; for Jim so far, an&#8217; everybody
thought his success was sartin, but he soon
came tarr&#8217;ble nigh makin&#8217; a tragedy ov hisself,
poor chap.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was a young widow woman came
ti live doon here at the Prospect House
ower there. She&#8217;d been married on a fat
old chap that had made a lot o&#8217; brass i&#8217; the
toon i&#8217; publics, an&#8217; they used to come here
for a bit i&#8217; the summer, an&#8217; when he died she
comes doon ti the &#8220;Prospect&#8221; ti bide for
good an&#8217; aal.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I sometimes think,&#8217; continued my companion
after a slight pause, &#8216;that it&#8217;s a sair
pity folks isn&#8217;t sometimes drooned like kittens
or &#8220;put under&#8221; same as dogs that turn oot
no use. It wud save a lot o&#8217; misfortunes an&#8217;
misery, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d, an&#8217; unless ye drooned a
Gladstone, or a John Wesley, or mevvies
even a &#8220;Heckler,&#8221; the world would be aal
the better o&#8217;t.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Anyways, she should have been drooned
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
slap off as a babby, for she was a rank bad
un&#8212;just rank bad ti the bone&#8212;an&#8217; when a
woman is bad, she&#8217;s just the devil&#8217;s own
viewer<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_11" href="#en_11">[11]</a></span> or deputy, by Gox!
</p>

<p>
&#8216;She had been on the stage, &#8217;twas said, at
one time, an&#8217; there was queer stories aboot
her, so that the gentry-folk aboot here would
have nowt ti do wiv her, sae she had aal the
better opportunity ti play her tricks wi&#8217; Jim.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;She was free wi&#8217; the brass, ye ken, an&#8217;
give subscriptions awa for the askin&#8217;, providin&#8217;
she had her name an&#8217; address clagged
up large on the play-bills, an&#8217; was a champion
at gettin&#8217; up concerts for wor Mechanic Institute
an&#8217; such-like entertainments.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;That was hoo she first got a hand upon
Jim, for he had a gran&#8217; voice&#8212;a perfect
champion at harmony he was, an&#8217; she just
buttered him up properly. It was &#8220;Oh,
Mr. Hedley, an&#8217; what a fortin ye would have
made in the Opera!&#8221; &#8220;Sing it again, Mr.
Hedley, it&#8217;s fair ravishin&#8217;,&#8221; an&#8217; so she carried
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
on till she had him awa to practise duetties
wiv her at her hoos, an&#8217; made him stay
ti supper wi&#8217; glasses o&#8217; wine tiv it&#8212;yellow
shampain wine that&#8217;ll set your brain iv a
froth, I b&#8217;lieve, an&#8217; at the finish she has him
just drugged wiv her enchantments.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was one night I mind I was oot
walkin&#8217; an&#8217; chanst ti pass by alang that road
there that leads past the hoos&#8212;the trees
wasn&#8217;t grown up then, ye ken, an&#8217; I could
spy a bit in through the windie, which was
open on the night&#8212;it bein&#8217; summer then,
d&#8217;ye see.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;She was settin&#8217; beside the pianner playin&#8217;
pretence wiv it, an&#8217; castin&#8217; up white eye-glances
at Jim soft-like, noo an&#8217; again, with a
sort ov insolence, too, as though she kenned
her power ower him&#8212;drawin&#8217; oot the very
marrow an&#8217; soul ov him wiv her perfections.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;She was aal clad i&#8217; silks an&#8217; satins, like a
play-actress&#8212;her bosom gleamin&#8217; wi&#8217; jools,
an&#8217; Jim was leanin&#8217; against the pianner gazin&#8217;
at her, fair drunk wiv her blandishments.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
&#8216;I cuddn&#8217;t stand by an&#8217; just do nowt ava,
sae I let fly a yell upon the night, &#8220;Ho-way
home ti thy own lawfu&#8217; missus, an&#8217; leave that
d&#8212;&#8212;d hussy alone.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He gave a sudden start at that, an&#8217; leaps
round ti the windie, claps it ti wiv a smash,
an&#8217; pulls the curtains ower it.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, I kenned then by that token that it
was aal ower wi&#8217; Jim. She had him fast, an&#8217;
nowt could be done, for interferin&#8217; i&#8217; them
cases is warse than useless; but I was sair,
sair grieved for him an&#8217; his wee quiet bonny-faced
wife, an&#8217; I walked awa home callin&#8217;
that woman aal things I could lay my tongue
ti under heaven.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Things went gradually from warse ti
warse; he neglected his work an&#8217; avoided
his wife, an&#8217; he became tarr&#8217;ble violent iv his
temper, an&#8217; nigh offered ti fight me yence
when I tried ti argy wiv him upon his
foolishness. Well, the crissis comes one
night when his wife follows him ti the
Prospect Hoos an&#8217; walks straight inti the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
drorin&#8217;-room where him an&#8217; the other woman
was. He&#8217;d just been threatened by the
viewer, d&#8217;ye see, wi&#8217; gettin&#8217; his notice if he
didn&#8217;t pull hisself tegither, an&#8217; knawin&#8217; things
were aaltegither wrang wiv him, he just gans
slap off ti the woman oot o&#8217; pure recklessness,
for he was none o&#8217; yo&#8217;r half an&#8217; half gentlemen,
an&#8217; as he was gannin&#8217; ti the deevil, wey,
he wud gan wiv a brass band, ye ken.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;His wife comes in upon them like a ghost,
an&#8217; never heedin&#8217; the other woman, cries tiv
him, haudin&#8217; oot her arms for him, &#8220;Oh,
come back, Jim, come back; divvn&#8217;t break
my heart!&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Jim says nowt, but glares moodily on the
ground, an&#8217; there&#8217;s silence for a bit. Then
the woman begins ti laugh saftly tiv herself,
eyein&#8217; Jim&#8217;s missus scornfu&#8217; like frae top ti
toe standin&#8217; there, small an&#8217; shabby-dressed
an&#8217; tearfu&#8217;, an&#8217;, &#8220;Wey doesn&#8217;t thoo gan?&#8221;
says she, &#8220;here&#8217;s yo&#8217;r hooskeeper come ti
fetch thoo home!&#8221; she says.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Jim gies a start at this an&#8217; looks up wi&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
blazing eyes at his temptress, then he says
tiv his wife, &#8220;Gan home, Mary, gan home;
this is no a fit place for thoo,&#8221; an&#8217; sae she
gans awa softly, weepin&#8217; like a desolate bairn.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Soon as the door shuts he turns upon the
other woman, an&#8217; he says sternly, &#8220;This is
the end o&#8217;t, Susan; I&#8217;m gannin&#8217; awa&#8217; an&#8217; ye&#8217;ll
never see me mair. You&#8217;ve plenty brass, an&#8217;
can fend for yo&#8217;rself. I&#8217;ve given thoo my
life, an&#8217; I can do nae mair; sae good-bye,
my lass, for ever an&#8217; aye.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;But she rushes tiv him, an&#8217; clasps her
arms roond aboot his neck an&#8217; sweethearts
him an&#8217; swears they must get married; but
Jim, he puts her quietly awa&#8217;, an&#8217; wiv a
stone-set face gans oot o&#8217; the hoos an&#8217;
straight for the shore.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Tossin&#8217; his cap on ti the ground, he
walks right inti the waters an&#8217; begins swimmin&#8217;
oot, right oot inti the sea, there ti
droon hissel&#8217; an&#8217; his troubles straight awa.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, mevvies he was ower strong ti be
easy ti droon; mevvies the cold water cleared
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
his mind a bit, an&#8217; he thought shame on
hissel&#8217; ti leave wife an&#8217; bairns ti shift for
theirsels; anyhoo, as he said efter, when he
saw the red light of a little schooner ridin&#8217;
waitin&#8217; for the tide off the harbour, a thought
cam intiv his brain, &#8220;Wey not gan right
awa an&#8217; make a fresh start iv a fresh place?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The thought grows on him, an&#8217; he swims
oot ti the schooner just as she was standin&#8217;
awa for London town, an&#8217; he hails her an&#8217; is
taken on board i&#8217; the nick o&#8217; time. Another
minute an&#8217; she would have been oot o&#8217; sight
an&#8217; hearin&#8217;, an&#8217; Jim would have been a corpse
in another ten minutes, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, nowt is heard ov him for months
an&#8217; months. &#8220;The Heckler&#8221; carves an &#8220;In
memoriov&#8217;m&#8221; on that headstone; his missus
gans inti &#8220;blacks,&#8221; an&#8217; the other woman
leaves the Prospect Hoos an&#8217; gans right awa
from these parts.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;One day though, Jim&#8217;s missus comes
alang tiv us cryin&#8217; an&#8217; laughin&#8217; aal at yence,
haudin&#8217; up a letter and kissin&#8217; it between
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
whiles. &#8220;It&#8217;s from Jim! Jim!&#8221; she cries,
&#8220;an&#8217; Jim, sweet Jim, he kept hissel&#8217; alive for
me an&#8217; Jackie an&#8217; Sal! Oh, he loves me yet,
my Jim!&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, it seems as hoo he had gan oot tiv
Australia, an&#8217; efter a bit wanderin&#8217; had gettened
hisself a very canny sitivation at a
gold mine, an&#8217; he sends aff at yence for his
missus an&#8217; bairns, an&#8217; a week later awa they
starts.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;They finds Jim doin&#8217; first-class when they
gets there, an&#8217; he went ahead like a hoos-o&#8217;-fire
as soon as he gets his missus an&#8217; bairns
back tiv hissel&#8217;, an&#8217; the past wiv its clartiness
was just clean wiped out between them.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;An&#8217; noo he&#8217;s the Right Honourable the
Lord Mayor o&#8217; Ballarat, or some such place,
an&#8217; cannot mak&#8217; enough ov his missus and
bairns, they say.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There&#8217;s some women mevvies,&#8217; added
&#8216;the Heckler&#8217; in conclusion, &#8216;who wouldn&#8217;t
have pardoned their man, but she was one o&#8217;
the sort that are just faithfu&#8217; ti death&#8212;nowt
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
can tarr&#8217;fy them aff, an&#8217; it&#8217;s fair providential
that it should be so, for there&#8217;s many men
noo livin&#8217; who wud just have been iv hell
lang syne else.&#8217;

<h2>&#8216;THE HECKLER&#8217; UPON WOMENFOLK</h2>

<p>
&#8216;Men are kittle cattle enough,&#8217; replied
&#8216;the Heckler&#8217; oracularly, from his
position of vantage on the top of a gate,
to some question of mine concerning an
indignation meeting held recently to protest
against some matter about which no two
people could give a like account; &#8216;but
they&#8217;re nowt ti what womenfolk is. Ye
can get roond most men easy enough if
ye&#8217;ve a bit tax.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Tax?&#8217; I queried aloud, somewhat mystified.
&#8216;What tax? not rates an&#8217; tax&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Gan on wi&#8217; thoo&#8212;rates an&#8217; taxes be
d&#8212;&#8212;!&#8217; retorted the oracle swiftly. &#8216;No, nowt
ti do wi&#8217; them things; just tax, or tacts,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
mevvies it is, meanin&#8217; a pleasant way wi&#8217;
ye, a bit touch o&#8217; the cap when the manager&#8217;s
vext wi&#8217; ye, a turn o&#8217; management when a
drunken man wants ti fight ye for nowt at
aal, ye ken, an&#8217; sae forth. Wow, but ye can
fettle most things amangst men wiv a little
o&#8217; that social lubricant, but wi&#8217; women it&#8217;s
different aaltigether; tax is nae use wi&#8217; them;
it&#8217;s just throwin&#8217; pearls before swine.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Holloa!&#8217; I interrupted again. &#8216;What
would the missus say to that?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Not hevin&#8217; heard it, she&#8217;ll say nowt,&#8217;
retorted &#8216;the Heckler&#8217; severely.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, as I was aboot to say when thoo
forgot theeself, and disturbed the meetin&#8217; wi&#8217;
yor interruptions, most men has foibles&#8212;some&#8217;s
dog-men like myself, some&#8217;s book-men,
some&#8217;s gard&#8217;ners, some&#8217;s beer-barrils,
an&#8217; sae forth, an&#8217; if ye mind this ye can get
what ye want usuallies oot o&#8217; them. But
women&#8217;s a different breed aaltigether. They
divvn&#8217;t care for the same things as men, an&#8217;
ye cannet get roond them, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d, for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
they elwis gets roond ye instead. A man
has no ambitions till he&#8217;s married, Maistor
John. Mevvies he&#8217;s keen aboot this, an&#8217;
that, an&#8217; &#8217;tother thing, but that&#8217;s nowt. Noo,
woman&#8217;s just chockfull ov ambitions aal her
life long, an&#8217;s nivvor, no, nivvor, satisfied
from her cradle tiv her grave, an&#8217; even then
she&#8217;s wantin&#8217; fower horses tiv her hearse.
Tak&#8217; a wee girlie for an instance: she&#8217;s elwis
wantin&#8217; new claes; then she&#8217;s wantin&#8217; a
man, then bairns, then a hoos ov her own,
then a better cloak than Mariarann nex&#8217;
door; an&#8217; when she gets them aal she&#8217;s not
satisfied, not one little bit, but&#8217;s warse than
ivvor.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Noo I&#8217;ll gie ye an instance o&#8217;t.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ye&#8217;ll dootless mind havin&#8217; seen or heard
tell ov Tom Archbold, yence fore overman
here i&#8217; the aad pit, a great, big, buirdly man,
champion hewer o&#8217; the colliery at one time,
who aye took the lead i&#8217; the village at every
bit sport, an&#8217; carry-on, an&#8217; jollification that
might be gannin&#8217; on at any time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
&#8216;Well, there was a little wee bit lassie ov
aboot twenty-five years ov age, who had
been married yence, but had lost her man
iv an accident doon the pit&#8212;a fall o&#8217; stone,
ye ken&#8212;an&#8217; nae sooner has she buried
him than she&#8217;s on the look-oot for anither
mate.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, bein&#8217; the littlest woman i&#8217; the
village, she natorally&#8212;such bein&#8217; woman&#8217;s
human nature&#8212;tak&#8217;s a fancy for the biggest
man iv it, meanin&#8217; Tom Archbold, an&#8217; she
gans for him straight awa.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ye&#8217;ll hev seen a setter dog workin&#8217; for a
partridge or a rabbit iv a rough grass field,
mevvies. Weel, it was just the same method
o&#8217; procedure wiv her. She gets a scent o&#8217;
what she was wantin&#8217;; she draws upon him
up wind; then she gets a tip-toe, steals tiv
him till her breath&#8217;s fair upon him, an&#8217; the
man&#8217;s done&#8212;fair done&#8212;clean copped, and it&#8217;s
&#8220;for better an&#8217; warse till death do us part.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;So it was wi&#8217; Lizzie an&#8217; Tom.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Tom was a weeda (widower), an&#8217; on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
look-out for anither missus, an&#8217; havin&#8217; had
a great big woman for his first&#8212;a proper
marrow ov himself i&#8217; size an&#8217; shape&#8212;an&#8217; not
havin&#8217; been ower well satisfied wiv his venture,
he thinks he&#8217;ll try a smaller article for his
second lott&#8217;ry.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, Tom was elwis very free an&#8217; open
wiv his conversation, an&#8217; mevvies Lizzie,
she gets ti hear ov it; but she pretends ti
tak&#8217; no notice o&#8217; Tom when she passes along
the Raa,<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_12" href="#en_12">[12]</a></span> or meets Tom i&#8217; the street. She
just sails past him, noo wiv head i&#8217; the air,
again wiv her eyes upon the ground, mournfu&#8217;
like for the loss of her man, an&#8217; Tom
becomes quite bewitched by her manners,
for she was a fair contrast wiv Bella, who
had ti tarrify him wiv a summons from the
pollis at the finish before she could get him
ti marry her i&#8217; chorch.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, she bags him clivvor at the finish,
an&#8217; they gets theyselves married wivoot
more ado.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
&#8216;A week efter comes &#8220;pay-Friday,&#8221;<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_13" href="#en_13">[13]</a></span> an&#8217;,
natorally, quite apart from the &#8220;celebration
of his nuptials,&#8221; as the newspaper cheps say,
he gets hissel&#8217; as boosy as can be, what wi&#8217;
standin&#8217; treat, an&#8217; bein&#8217; treat an&#8217; aal, an&#8217; efter
closin&#8217; time it was wi&#8217; some difficulty that me
an&#8217; my marrer gets him along home.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;We knocks on the door, an&#8217; we assists
him in, an&#8217; he staggers up tiv his missus, who
was sittin&#8217; iv her armchair knittin&#8217;, an&#8217; tries
ti gie her a bit chuck under the chin. &#8220;Ho&#8212;way&#8212;&#8212;,&#8221;
he stutters, &#8220;Lizzie, maa lass,
an&#8217; put us ti bed!&#8221; an&#8217; stoopin&#8217; down iv a
staggerin&#8217; way ti kiss her loses his balance,
an&#8217; flops doon unexpected on the floor.
&#8220;Ye needn&#8217;t wait,&#8221; Lizzie says tiv us,
haughty-like, takin&#8217; no notice o&#8217; Tom, an&#8217;
sae oot we gans, an&#8217; leaves them. But we
just stops a minute ootside ti hear Lizzie gie
him his gruel; an&#8217;, wow! but she let him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
have it, an&#8217; no mistake! &#8220;Thoo great
flamin&#8217; drunken lubbert!&#8221; says she, &#8220;comin&#8217;
home ti my hoos at this time o&#8217; night, drunk
as a lord, an&#8217; only been married a week!&#8221; she
cries. &#8220;Thoo mun just get used wiv it, maa
lass,&#8221; says he solemnly from the floor; &#8220;for
aa elwis gets drunk reg&#8217;lor on a pay-Friday;
an&#8217; it&#8217;sh maa hoos thoo &#8212;&#8212;, for aa&#8217;s
maistor,&#8221; he says, thinkin&#8217;, mevvies, he mun
assert hissel&#8217; even if he has had his gills.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Put thoo ti bed?&#8221; cries she. &#8220;Wey,
I&#8217;ll not touch thoo, nor let thoo touch me
nowther till thoo&#8217;s sober again, an&#8217;s begged
maa pardon.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Pardon-sh?&#8221; says Tom, an&#8217; laughs, fair
amused by her impittence. &#8220;Wey, if maa
legs wesn&#8217;t sae wambly the night, I&#8217;d larn
thoo a lesson, thoo &#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Get up, an&#8217; try, thoo sponge o&#8217; beer,&#8221;
she says, an&#8217; snaps her fingers iv his face.
&#8220;Get up, an&#8217; try,&#8221; cries she again. &#8220;I daur
thoo ti;&#8221; an&#8217; she actually has the impittence
ti stir him wiv her foot. Just fancy that!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
A yard an&#8217; a half o&#8217; petticoat, fair insultin&#8217;
upon a proper mountain ov a man like Tom!
The door was a bit open, d&#8217;ye see, an&#8217; my
marrer an&#8217; me could see them two comics
quite plain.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, Tom, he thinks things is comin&#8217;
tiv a pretty pass if his missis is gannin&#8217; ti
clean her boots on him efter a week&#8217;s
marryin&#8217;; so, much against his will, he pulls
hissel&#8217; tegither, an&#8217; by the help o&#8217; the bedpost
gets on his feet.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Wey,&#8221; cries Lizzie again, lookin&#8217; him
ower mair scornfu&#8217; than ever, &#8220;thoo&#8217;s as
unsteady on thy feet as a horse wi&#8217; the
staggers!&#8221; she says. &#8220;I could knock thoo
doon wi&#8217; one finger!&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;I bet-sh a sovereign thoo cannet; ay,
an&#8217; anither that I&#8217;ll drive yo&#8217;r lugs reet intiv
yo&#8217;r heid wi&#8217; one bat o&#8217; my fist,&#8221; says he;
an&#8217; he puffs hissel&#8217; oot as he searches for the
coin, an&#8217; spits on his hands iv a preliminary
sort o&#8217; way.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Then, sudden, she comes up tiv him, gies
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
him a tap wiv her forefinger, unexpected like,
straight on the breast, an&#8217; Tom, taken unawares,
lurches backward, catches his foot iv
a bracket, crashes intiv a chair, an&#8217; falls wiv
a tarr&#8217;ble thump an&#8217; a racket of furniture
straight on ti the flaggin&#8217;. He gies a little
lift ov his head as he looks up in a dazed way
for a moment from the floor. Then he says,
sinkin&#8217; back again, &#8220;There&#8217;s been a fall o&#8217;
stone; gan an&#8217; fetch the depity,&#8221; he says,
then sort o&#8217; dwams (swoons) awa.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Lizzie, she looks him ower for awhile,
cool as a policeman wiv a lantern, then lifts a
pillow off the bed, an&#8217; puts it under his head
as he lies stretched upon the floor. Next,
she takes the boots off her man, an&#8217; sae
leaves him ti bide where he lies, whilst she
gans ti bed her lane.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Next mornin&#8217; Tom feels hissel&#8217; as sick as
a bad bat o&#8217; the head an&#8217; a wambly stomach
can make a man, an&#8217; &#8220;lies in&#8221; while his missus
gies him warm things ti drink, an&#8217; tends him
like a bairn.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
&#8216;Well, she has him properly caught, for he
has ti lie there idle the best part ov a week,
an&#8217; cannet work for another week efter that,
the skelp he&#8217;d got frae the fall bein&#8217; a serious
affair, as it seemed.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;When he gets up again he was sae savage
at the chaff he gets aboot bein&#8217; knocked
doon biv his missus that he gans back tiv
his hoos iv a hurry, tak&#8217;s off his belt, an&#8217; is
gannin&#8217; ti strap her within an inch ov her life,
when she says, &#8220;Tom, an&#8217; who was it that&#8217;s
been nursin&#8217; thoo this last fortnight?&#8221; An&#8217;
she axes it quietly, facin&#8217; him wivoot a
tremor, her eyes fixed upon his.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Tom stands there wiv his arm uplifted;
but though he was hot ti strike her, somehoo
or ither, as he said efter, he was fair bested
if he could manage it.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, that was aboot the beginnin&#8217; an&#8217;
the end o&#8217;t, for she&#8217;d conquered him properly,
an&#8217; Mister Six-Foot-Two soon found oot
he&#8217;d got a proper taskmaster for his missus,
even though she was but a yard an&#8217; a half
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
high, an&#8217; looked as though ye could have
snapt her across yor arm. She didn&#8217;t knock
him doon again, but she was elwis surprisin&#8217;
him inti startin&#8217; things, an&#8217; when he tired ov
it she would scorn him a bit, an&#8217; ask, &#8220;An&#8217;
what&#8217;s the good o&#8217; bein&#8217; a strong man if ye
cannet show yor strength? Any fool can
get drunk,&#8221; says she, &#8220;an&#8217; lose his brass
bettin&#8217;; but thoo&#8217;s a strong man, Tom, I&#8217;s
warn&#8217;d, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve bet Ned Lee&#8217;s wife a dollar
that thoo can walk past the Pitman&#8217;s Arms
on pay-Friday night wivvoot ever lookin&#8217;
inside!&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, that was the way o&#8217;t i&#8217; Lizzie&#8217;s
case. She soon had her Samson&#8217;s locks
clipped short, an&#8217; iv a few years&#8217; time he
becomes a depity, a back overman, an&#8217; finally
fore overman, has a hoos ov his own, an&#8217; a
whole raa (row) o&#8217; cottages.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Some has different ways from others,&#8217;
reflected my companion, further, &#8216;but aal
womenfolk&#8217;s ambitious.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Noo, tak&#8217; my own case&#8212;&#8220;the Heckler&#8217;s&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
&#8212;when I got married on the aad lady there
was no nonsense aboot the business.
&#8220;Ho-way,&#8221; I says, &#8220;will ye tak&#8217; us, Betty?&#8221;
for I kenned nicely beforehand she was the
right sort for us, havin&#8217; obsarved her
previous, an&#8217; walked oot wiv her a Sunday
night or two. &#8220;Ay, an&#8217; I will, Geordie,&#8221;
she says thankfully, an&#8217; as meek as skim
milk; but for aal that I&#8217;ve been got the best
o&#8217; lots o&#8217; time biv her ambition, an&#8217; noo, here
I is, wiv a fam&#8217;ly o&#8217; seven, an&#8217; the missus
insistin&#8217; upon Harry&#8217;s&#8212;that&#8217;s the eldest boy,
ye ken&#8212;gannin&#8217; ti the Grammar School ti
parfect hissel&#8217; as a scholar. Ay, wor Harry&#8217;s
a proper scholar, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d, but schoolin&#8217;s
tarr&#8217;ble expensive.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;An&#8217; noo, I&#8217;ll just gie ye this bit advice,
Maistor John. Divvn&#8217;t thoo get married
unless thoo marries a heiress, for, I tell thoo,
aal women&#8217;s ambitious, an&#8217; ambition&#8217;s a
tarr&#8217;ble expensive hobby.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Gox! yes, just fearful, Maistor John.&#8217;

<h2>THE &#8216;CALEB JAY&#8217;<br />
    <span class="smaller">(THE &#8216;<span xml:lang="fr">QUEL OBJÊT</span>&#8217;)</span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>
The &#8216;Caleb Jay&#8217;<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_14" href="#en_14">[14]</a></span> was not, as his nickname
of itself might testify, popular
in our pit village of Black Winning. His
appearance was against him in the first
instance, and he continued to be shy and
reserved even after you might be said to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
have made his acquaintance. Reserve is
unpopular in any society, but in the lower
social grades, where life is of a freer and
more hearty character than in the propriety-loving
circles of the well-to-do, it may be
said to be one of the &#8216;seven deadly sins.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
There was no reserve about Tom, his
elder brother, who was a good-looking, idle,
somewhat dissolute youth of twenty-three
years of age.
</p>

<p>
Tom was always ready to &#8216;stand in&#8217; for a
&#8216;ha&#8217;penny loo,&#8217; never flinched from a &#8216;bout
at the beer,&#8217; could throw a quoit well, when
his eye was clear and his hand steady, and
was never at a loss with the lasses.
</p>

<p>
Tom, therefore, was a general favourite,
being &#8216;well ta&#8217;en up wi&#8217;&#8217; by all save a few of
the more serious-minded people; and &#8216;Caleb
Jay&#8217; suffered, I think, partly through contrast
with his brother.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Caleb Jay&#8217; had been injured when working
as a putter down the pit, and consequently
was &#8216;game of one leg.&#8217; He wore
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the cast-off finery of his brother, the coloured
scarves and embroidered waistcoats of his
festive occasions&#8212;out of economy, no doubt,
but some said &#8216;oot o&#8217; foolishness.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Certainly they did not suit well with his
sallow complexion and thin, peaked countenance,
and with the big and weary eyes.
</p>

<p>
He worked now at any odd job he could
find. He had the care of the viewer&#8217;s strip
of kitchen garden, and went round with
papers, etc.; but it was not much that he
earned, apparently, for his mother, who doted
on her handsome son Tom, was often heard
to complain that he wasn&#8217;t worth his
keep.
</p>

<p>
He had a strange way of mysteriously
disappearing for some days on occasion,
sometimes even for a week at a stretch, and
sundry persons, annoyed perhaps by his
reticence, hinted at secret dissipation.
</p>

<p>
If closely questioned, he would admit having
had a &#8216;job i&#8217; the toon,&#8217; or &#8216;ower away yonder,&#8217;
pointing vaguely this way or that; and gossip
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
had at least this confirmation for its uncharitable
suspicion, that he always returned
pale, tired and haggard-looking.
</p>

<p>
Some of the boys had tried to &#8216;nab&#8217; him
either coming or going on one of these
expeditions of his, but he was &#8216;cuter nor a
cushat&#8217;<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_15" href="#en_15">[15]</a></span> as I overheard a sporting youth
lament who had followed him in early morning
all the way to Oldcastle, and there in the
suburbs had suddenly lost him just on the
brink of discovering the secret.
</p>

<p>
Gradually we became accustomed to his
flittings, and he was spied upon no more;
but for my own part I thought I had, by a
comparison of the times and seasons of his
absences, at least discovered this much&#8212;that
he was usually away at the incidence
of fairs and festivals.
</p>

<p>
I think I knew him more intimately than
any other person in the village, except,
perhaps, our Methodist minister, who never
rested till he had succoured any who might
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
be in &#8216;sickness, sorrow, or distress&#8217;; but to
neither of us, I found, on comparing notes,
had he ever vouchsafed any confidences.
</p>

<p>
The only way in which I eventually discovered
I could be of any use to him was by
lending him books. He was extremely fond
of reading, and had a special taste for dramatic
poetry, which he occasionally gratified by
coming to my lodgings, and there devouring
the historical plays and tragedies of
Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
I had once or twice on these occasions
endeavoured to extort from him the secret
of his absences, but the only result had been
an increased reserve on his part, followed by
an almost immediate departure from my
presence, so that I had soon desisted from
further questioning him on the point.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, I confess I entertained
a lingering hope that I might one day be
able to penetrate the mystery; for mystery
of some sort I was convinced it was, though
not of a vulgar kind.
</p>


<h3>II.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></h3>

<p>
It so chanced that I was detained in
Bridgeton on the day of the annual fair and
hiring, and having two hours to wait for my
train, I determined to pass the time away by
noting the humours of the festival. Farmers&#8217;
wives, laden with &#8216;remnants&#8217; and cheap
bargains in the hardware line, were slowly
surging through the throng, towards the
various publics, in search of their &#8216;men&#8217; and
the &#8216;trap.&#8217; Hinds, male and female, having
now &#8216;bound their bargains&#8217; with their masters,
were coasting round the booths and stalls,
&#8216;putting in&#8217; at all the ale-houses they passed
in their uncertain voyaging.
</p>

<p>
The men were somewhat sheepish still,
not having taken sufficient beer on board as
yet to lose the shyness of the countryman in
town. They confined themselves to chaffing
one another, to casting stray glances at their
sweethearts, who tittered in their wake, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to offering, when moved to gallantry, &#8216;anuther
glass o&#8217; yel.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
A squad of pitmen here and there, their
customary rivalries heated with liquor, were
challenging each other noisily at the various
&#8216;try-your-strengths&#8217; and &#8216;prove-your-powers&#8217;
that were anchored in the corners of the
market-place.
</p>

<p>
My attention was next attracted by the
clash of cymbals and flamboyant drum-drubbings.
&#8216;&#8217;Ere y&#8217;are, ladies and gents,
&#8217;ere y&#8217;are! Yo&#8217;r friend an&#8217; acquaintance Bob
Stevens, wiv his high-class dancin&#8217;, trapezin&#8217;,
Shakespearian an&#8217; variety entertainment!&#8217;
</p>

<p>
The great flaring gas-brackets, with their
smoky tongues stabbing the darkness fitfully,
lit up a most delectable advertisement. I
produced &#8216;tuppence,&#8217; &#8216;walked up,&#8217; as invited,
to the tent, and found myself in the &#8216;hall of
amusement and instruction combined.&#8217; It
was already crowded, but I eventually discovered
a seat in the far corner.
</p>

<p>
Cries of &#8216;Back! back!&#8217;<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_16" href="#en_16">[16]</a></span> were still ringing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in the air, and after a moment or two a most
cadaverous-looking clown reappeared and
advanced to the footlights.
</p>

<p>
His haggard, melancholy mien was in
admirable artistic contrast to his garb and
the burlesque humour of his song. &#8216;<em>And
oh</em>,&#8217; sang he, at the end of each verse relating
some contretemps of the bashful lover, &#8216;<em>it
makes me very, very lively! Very, very lively!</em>&#8217;
he repeated, as he step-danced up and down
the tiny stage amidst the guffaws of his
audience.
</p>

<p>
It was no great thing to do, perhaps; but
it was admirably done. There was no
extravagance in his accompanying actions,
nor exaggeration of emphasis anywhere. In
short, there was something of the genuine
artist in him, and it was evident that he held
his quaintly assorted &#8216;tuppeny&#8217; audience in
his grasp.
</p>

<p>
I grew strangely interested in the queer
little figure before me. Something about
him appealed strongly to the imagination.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
He was encored again, and as I watched
him more narrowly his aspect became more
and more pathetic. I grew convinced that
he was suffering physical pain; the blot of
vermilion on his nose glowed brighter;
beneath his mask of white I could see ashen-coloured
lines streaking a colourless face.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Poor little chap,&#8217; thought I; &#8216;he&#8217;s
starving!&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Just at that moment he concluded at the
&#8216;wings,&#8217; bowing to the audience. His linen
blouse blew open as he turned, and below
a ragged shirt thus momentarily visible I
saw that which made me suddenly feel sick.
Before I recovered myself he had passed out
on a step, humming his refrain, &#8216;<em>Oh, it makes
me very, very lively!</em>&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Now, what I saw was a tumour which
could only mean one thing, and that was
death&#8212;an early and painful death probably.
&#8216;He&#8217;s not starving,&#8217; I muttered to myself;
&#8216;poor little chap, he&#8217;s dying!&#8217;
</p>

<p>
I thought I would go out into the fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
air, but as I prepared to rise my eye caught
sight of a chink in the canvas through which
the &#8216;green room&#8217; was visible.
</p>

<p>
The trapeze gentleman was now performing,
and the clown was removing his &#8216;make
up.&#8217; Now that he was off the stage I could
see that he had a limp. A gust of wind
came suddenly, enlarging the opening. He
turned, apparently to close the orifice; his
eyes met mine, and in that startled second
I knew him to be the &#8216;Caleb Jay.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Repressing a cry of surprise, I came out,
and went round to the back to wait for him.
</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>
&#8216;Now, tell me,&#8217; said I, as I led him up to
the station, &#8216;why do you do it? You know
you oughtn&#8217;t to, for it will kill you if you
exert yourself like that.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay, an&#8217; that&#8217;s why,&#8217; replied he, &#8216;for I ken
I&#8217;m dyin&#8217;; I went an&#8217; axed a doctor a while
back, iv Oldcastle, an&#8217; he says, &#8220;I&#8217;ll gie ye a
year ti live at the ootside,&#8221; says he.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
&#8216;Then, why do it?&#8217; I urged. &#8216;Do you
love it so, or is it for the sake of the money?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay,&#8217; he replied, gasping a little, as we
mounted the slope to the station, &#8216;that&#8217;s it.
It&#8217;s for the brass. Ye ken Tom, my brother?
Well, it&#8217;s for him i&#8217; pairt, an&#8217; i&#8217; pairt for my
mother, who wants a bit frae me for my
keep, ye ken. Noo, Tom&#8217;s a bonny fellow,
ain&#8217;t he?&#8212;just a joy ti the eye ti look upon;
an&#8217; he&#8217;s aye wantin&#8217; a bit mair brass for this,
an&#8217; that, an&#8217; t&#8217;ither, an&#8217;, man, it&#8217;s a pleasure ti
me ti slave a bit for him. There&#8217;s nae use o&#8217;
brass for me&#8212;me that&#8217; just the puir &#8220;Caleb
Jay&#8221;&#8212;but Tom&#8217;s like a live lord when he&#8217;s
plenty of brass; an&#8217;, man, but he spends it
weel!&#8217;
</p>

<p>
I was silent for a while, thinking of the
tragedy of it all. Then I inquired again:
&#8216;Well, but how did you know you had this
gift of acting and singing and impersonation?
and why did you hide your talent so
carefully from us all?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It came ower us first, I think,&#8217; he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
answered, &#8216;when reading Shakespeare an&#8217;
tragedies an&#8217; sic like. I seemed ti see the
vary actors theirselves before my eyes, an&#8217; I
fair felt like them, ye ken. Ye&#8217;ll think it
strange, mevvies, but grandfeythor, he had
a bit talent that way, an&#8217; ran awa frae his
home, an&#8217; made his livin&#8217; play-acting an&#8217;
piano-playin&#8217;, an&#8217; singin&#8217;, an&#8217; aal. He took
ill somewhere aboot here, an&#8217; died, an&#8217;
feythor, he took ti warkin&#8217; at the pits, an&#8217;
that&#8217;s the story of it,&#8217; concluded my little
companion shyly.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;But with a gift like yours, why didn&#8217;t you
tell <em>me</em> of it, for example, or the minister,
and perhaps we could have got you a proper
start somewhere?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay, I kenned that,&#8217; said he, &#8216;an&#8217; thank
ye kindlies; but I found, on tryin&#8217; it, that I
wesn&#8217;t strang enow for&#8217;t iv a reg&#8217;lor way; an&#8217;
forbye that, I didn&#8217;t want the laddies ti ken
aboot it, lest they might call us &#8220;Hamlet,&#8221;
mevvies, or &#8220;clownie,&#8221; or sic like, an&#8217; my
mother divvent like play-actin&#8217;; it was she as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
made my feythor give it up, sayin&#8217; it wes nae
bettor than a mugger&#8217;s<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_17" href="#en_17">[17]</a></span> life, elwis wanderin&#8217;
frae one place tiv anuther, an&#8217; nae brass iv it
at aal.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
There was no time for further talk, for the
train was waiting, and, arriving at our
destination, I found my companion so tired
that it was all he could do to walk home.
</p>

<p>
The minister and I put our heads together
after this, and collected enough money to
send our little friend down to a seaside home
for a few weeks.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday night, however, a message
came from the doctor that he was rapidly
sinking. His mother and brother were both
out, as it happened, but the minister and I
arrived just in time to bid farewell to the
poor little &#8216;Caleb Jay.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
As we proceeded silently homeward, an
idea came into my head.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;In an age of public testimonials and
memorials,&#8217; I said, &#8216;humble self-sacrifice
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
goes unrewarded. Our little friend ought to
have a statue at the least; but, of course, it
is no good doing anything. You, therefore,
should bring him into your sermon to-morrow
evening, and give a few people a hint of it
beforehand.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
The idea seemed to strike my companion,
and he said he would gladly do so.
</p>

<p>
I had not seen Tom, but as I walked to
my lodgings I passed him standing at the
street corner amidst a knot of companions.
</p>

<p>
I heard one of them mention the &#8216;Caleb
Jay,&#8217; and I stayed my steps a moment to
hear the reply.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay,&#8217; said Tom, &#8216;he was a plucky little
beggor iv his way, an&#8217; useful tae, an&#8217; I was
often sorry for him, <em>he wes sae tarr&#8217;ble ugly</em>!
But, ho-way, I&#8217;s plenty brass on me, and I&#8217;ll
treat ye aal tiv anuthor beor!&#8217;

<h2>GEORDIE ARMSTRONG, &#8216;THE JESU-YTE&#8217;</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>
Geordie Armstrong, after a
somewhat stormy past, had become
a steady hewer, and a local preacher of some
repute. Never a Sunday but he was &#8216;planned&#8217;
to speak at this or that village, and frequently,
as he found opportunity, would &#8216;pit in a bit
overtime&#8217; at a &#8216;class-meeting&#8217; or &#8216;knife-an&#8217;-fork
tea,&#8217; when the &#8216;asking a blessing&#8217; or
a returning of thanks might furnish occasion
for a &#8216;bit extemporizin&#8217;.&#8217; He was in receipt
of excellent wages down the pit; his wordly
goods comprised, as he often proclaimed,
a &#8216;bonny, an&#8217; what&#8217;s o&#8217; far mair importance,
a godly missus, three canny bairns, a cosy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
hoos, a fine little librairee, an&#8217; a tarr&#8217;ble
fertile garden.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
As he thought upon the sum of his
blessings one Saturday night when, after
having &#8216;weshed hissel&#8217; an&#8217; had his tea,&#8217; he
proceeded to light his pipe, he felt he could
only properly describe himself as a &#8216;varitable
corn-u-cop-ye-ar ov happiness.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Yet even then, even in that depth of
felicity, an uneasy feeling would intrude:
the memory of Scotty would float to the
surface of his mind, and the thought of the
&#8216;parlous state&#8217; in which his old &#8216;marrow&#8217;
(mate) stood would ruffle its calm placidity.
</p>

<p>
This was &#8216;the little rift within the lute&#8217;;
here was the caterpillar in the &#8216;corn-u-cop-ye-ar,&#8217;
and, like the Apostle Paul of old, he
was fain to accept his trial, in the spirit of
true humility, as a judgment upon him for
the failings of his past life.
</p>

<p>
It was not for lack of trying that Scotty
refused to come to chapel; indeed, Geordie
had so vexed him with his importunity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that Scotty had refused to work with
him any longer, and was now employed
further &#8216;in-by&#8217; with another mate. But for
all that, Geordie felt certain that the cause
of failure lay with himself, due probably to his
weakness in faith, to lack of some essential
or other, and that the blame of Scotty&#8217;s
not being &#8216;brought to the Lord&#8217; lay at his
door.
</p>

<p>
It had been evident to him for some time
that he must try other means, and, being a
great reader, he had latterly come across,
and been much attracted by, a remarkable
account of some ancient methods of the
&#8216;Jesu-ytes&#8217; in cases of this sort.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the sinner in question had been
unwittingly tempted into the &#8216;narrow path&#8217;
by the gratification of his ambitions on some
point or other, conversion resulting, as in the
case of Tom Appleby&#8212;once a fire-hot
Socialist, now a sleek Conservative&#8212;from
unexpected prosperity.
</p>

<p>
At other times the same end had been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
attained by a crafty flattery. Suppose a
man ambitious of eminence and State distinction:
he might be diverted from politics
to the Church, and many were the instances
given of bold and ambitious men who had
done great work and attained high place as
the servants of St. Peter.
</p>

<p>
Could Scotty not be caught hold of in
some such fashion? queried Geordie to himself,
as he sat by his fireside that night,
deeply pondering the records he had just
been studying. &#8216;I divvn&#8217;t think he&#8217;s ambitious,
for he cares nowt aboot politics, an&#8217;
he never even thought o&#8217; stannin&#8217; for election
on wor Parish Cooncil. Aal he cares for is
his beer, an&#8217; his quoits, an&#8217; bettin&#8217;, an&#8217;&#8212;an&#8217;&#8212;his
pansies; an&#8217; I doot I cannot catch haud
ov him in any one of those partic&#8217;lors, for it
wouldn&#8217;t be fittin&#8217; for us that&#8217;s a local preacher
to gan an&#8217; send him a barril o&#8217; beer, or back
him at a quoitin&#8217; match. But stay&#8212;there&#8217;s
the pansies; he&#8217;s pansy champion, dootless;
but then I&#8217;s leek champion, an&#8217; if I can grow
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
leeks, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d but I can grow pansies, for
flooers is easier grown nor vegetables.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Geordie puffed at his pipe vigorously for
a minute or two in silence as he turned the
matter over in his mind.
</p>

<p>
A light kindled slowly in the back of his
deep-set eye, a smile showed upon his lips,
then he cuffed himself vigorously upon the
knee.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ho-way, gan on, Geordie!&#8217; he encouraged
himself aloud; &#8216;thoo&#8217;s turnin&#8217; a fair Jesu-yte,
I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d!&#8217;
</p>

<p class="tb">
       *       *       *       *       *
</p>

<p>
As the day appointed for the annual meeting
of the Flower Show drew near, Geordie
had been heard to drop hints of the &#8216;wonnerfu&#8217;
new specie&#8217; of pansies he had become possessed
of&#8212;&#8216;seedlin&#8217;s&#8217; he had obtained &#8216;doon
the south-country way,&#8217; and it was not long
before the rumour reached the ears of
Scotty.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could exceed the contempt of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the latter when he heard of Geordie&#8217;s trying
to grow pansies&#8212;&#8216;him that&#8217;s just a vegetable
man, a tormut (turnip) grower, a sort o&#8217;
ha&#8217;penny farmer,&#8217; and as for anything good
in the way of seedlings coming out of the
south-country, it was just &#8216;bang ridi&#8217;klous,
for a&#8217; folk kenned that a&#8217; the best growers
lived in auld Scotland.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
By-and-by some mischievous individual
told Scotty that Geordie was &#8216;full&#8217; set upon
being pansy champion, and was so cock-sure
about it that he was willing to back
himself to win.
</p>

<p>
Scotty was so annoyed at this that the
next time he came across Geordie he could
not refrain from jeering at his attempt at
pansy growing. &#8216;Wey, it&#8217;ll be as muckle as
ye can do to tell a pansy frae a vi&#8217;let!&#8217; he
cried.
</p>

<p>
Geordie looked at him seriously from
under his bushy eyebrows as he replied, &#8216;I&#8217;s
gannin&#8217; to show&#8212;an&#8217; I&#8217;s gannin&#8217; to win&#8212;<em>wi&#8217;
pansies, not vi&#8217;lets</em>.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
&#8216;Will ye back yorsel&#8217;, then?&#8217; retorted his
opponent sneeringly.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, ye knaa,&#8217; replied the other slowly,
with evident embarrassment, &#8216;I&#8217;s not a bettin&#8217;
man, but if thoo thinks I&#8217;s not in earnest,
I&#8217;s willin&#8217; to gie a proof that I is. What
d&#8217;ye say to yor takin&#8217;&#8212;if ye beat us, that
is&#8212;anythin&#8217; oot o&#8217; my hoos thoo has a
fancy for; an&#8217;&#8212;an&#8217;&#8212;if I beat thoo, wey, aal
I axes is that thoo should come to chapel&#8212;noo
an&#8217; again, ye knaa&#8212;ov an evenin&#8217;,&#8217;
he hastily added, as his companion&#8217;s face
assumed a look of infinite scorn.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ha&#8217; ye got that auld double-barrelled
shot-gun yet?&#8217; queried Scotty, after a pause
in which he had arrived at the conclusion
that the odds were &#8216;aboot a thoosand to one&#8217;
in his favour.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Yes,&#8217; replied Geordie. &#8216;I still have her;
she&#8217;s there hangin&#8217; up above the mantelshelf.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, I&#8217;ll tak&#8217; up wi&#8217; yor proposal,&#8217; was
Scotty&#8217;s reply.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
&#8216;Shake hands on&#8217;t, then,&#8217; said Geordie
slowly, unsuccessfully endeavouring to instil
an apprehensive tremor into his voice.
</p>

<p>
His companion shook hands carelessly,
and swung away whistling barefacedly, &#8216;And
it&#8217;s up wi&#8217; the bonnets o&#8217; Bonnie Dundee.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Geordie, on his part, walked away swiftly
homewards, fearing lest his exultation might
betray itself too openly. &#8216;Wow!&#8217; he thought
to himself, &#8216;but I&#8217;s fair a-feard o&#8217; mysel&#8217;.
I&#8217;s growin&#8217; intiv a proper Jesu-yte!&#8217;
</p>

<p>
The morning of the show-day came, and
Geordie, having finished packing his exhibits
with extraordinary care, had just returned
with the small cart the grocer had lent him
to convey his treasures to the show-field,
about a mile and a half distant, when up
came Maggie, Scotty&#8217;s wife, who, notwithstanding
the little difference between their
respective men, had always kept up her
friendship with Geordie&#8217;s wife. Her arms
bore a large green case, tied round with a
many-knotted cord. This she hastily set
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
down beside the cart, then turned breathlessly
to Geordie, who, with his son, was just
about to drive off.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Eh noo, canny man,&#8217; she cried, as she
wiped her hot face with the tail of her gown,
&#8216;do us a favour. Will thoo carry my man&#8217;s
pansy-case up to the show wi&#8217; yors? Wor
Jimmy was to have taken it up first thing
this mornin&#8217;, but he went aff for his school
treat an&#8217; left it&#8212;an&#8217; my man&#8217;s awa playin&#8217;
hissel&#8217; at quoits&#8212;an&#8217; he&#8217;ll aboot kill Jimmy
when he gans up to the show an&#8217; finds his
pansies isn&#8217;t there.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Geordie willingly acceded, and the green
case was carefully deposited alongside of his
own at the bottom of the cart.
</p>

<p>
His nine-year-old son squatted on the seat
opposite, his legs up to his chin, so as to be
out of the way as much as possible in the
crowded cart. The pony started off gallantly
enough, and all went well till within about
two or three hundred yards of the field. At
that point, however, the pony suddenly shied
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
at some stray paper on the road, and Tommy
fell with a crash upon the green case below.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Eh, Tommy, lad!&#8217; cried his father in
dismay; &#8216;what hast thoo done? Wow! but
thoo&#8217;s gan an&#8217; smashed Scotty&#8217;s case right
thro&#8217; an&#8217; thro&#8217;!&#8217;
</p>

<p>
His succeeding feeling was one of joy;
for, the accident having irreparably damaged
a third at least of his rival&#8217;s pansies, it was
evident that Scotty was now &#8216;catched,&#8217;
and Geordie, with an inward acknowledgment
to Providence, saw, as in a vision,
Scotty sitting devoutly &#8216;under&#8217; himself in
chapel.
</p>

<p>
A few moments later, however, doubt and
dismay entered his soul. What if Scotty
should say Tommy had done it &#8216;o&#8217; purpose&#8217;&#8212;at
his instigation? Further reflection convinced
him that this was exactly what
Scotty would say, and doubtless there
would be some folk unkind enough to back
him up in it.
</p>

<p>
Scotty would likelies claim the gun.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Well, he&#8217;d not mind parting with that, but
he could not give up the prospect of saving
Scotty&#8217;s soul alive without a groan.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Eh, Tommy, lad! Eh, Tommy! But
thoo divvn&#8217;t knaa what thoo&#8217;s done; thoo&#8217;s
put us in a fine quandary,&#8217; he murmured,
gazing sadly now at Tommy, who was rubbing
his knee ruefully, and again at the
splintered case. The problem was a &#8216;puzzlor;&#8217;
even a Jesu-yte might have found solution
difficult; for Scotty, he knew, would not
believe him if he told the simple story of the
accident, and winning the prize would be
useless in the face of Scotty&#8217;s insinuations
of foul play.
</p>

<p>
The only way out of the difficulty, he
determined sadly, was to exhibit his own
pansies under Scotty&#8217;s name, and withdraw
from the contest himself. The contents of
the two cases were sufficiently alike for his
purpose, though his own were superior in
size and depth of colour. It was a &#8216;sair trial,&#8217;
for his pansies were bound to win; but his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
character as an honest, religious man was at
stake, and Scotty&#8217;s triumph would be easier
to endure than his sneers, if defeated, at a
&#8216;chap who caa&#8217;s hissel&#8217; releegious, an&#8217; swindles
ye like a Jew pedlar.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
With a groan he undid the label, and tied
it on to his own beloved specimens, casting
aside, as a temptation of the evil one, a disturbing
suggestion that he was guilty of
deception in passing off his own as Scotty&#8217;s
pansies.
</p>

<p class="tb">
       *       *       *       *       *
</p>

<p>
The judges had been round, and Scotty&#8217;s
pansies easily gained the place of pride;
pansies so perfectly developed, so dark and
deep in colour, had never been shown before.
</p>

<p>
A crowd of admirers stood round. Scotty
came lurching up, having evidently held a
preliminary carouse in certain expectation of
the championship, and, with a careless glance
at his exhibits and the red card attached,
cried triumphantly:
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay! an&#8217; whaur&#8217;s that Geordie body noo,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
wi&#8217; his brags an&#8217; a&#8217;? Wey, I&#8217;m tauld he
daurna even exhibit his ain puir specimens
by the side o&#8217; mine! Look at thae pansies,
an&#8217; think o&#8217; him wi&#8217; his yaller sheep&#8217;s tormuts
tryin&#8217; to vie wi&#8217; me that&#8217;s the auld established
pansy champion! Ay, I&#8217;m that ower an&#8217; ower
again; an&#8217; what&#8217;s mair, I&#8217;ve win his gun.
Wey, I&#8217;ll gang an&#8217; fetch her awa at aince!&#8217;
</p>

<p>
So boasting, the proud champion reeled off
in triumph, inadvertently knocking up against
a silent looker-on, who was standing in melancholy
guise against a tent-pole some little
distance away.
</p>

<p>
One morning, a day or so after the flower-show,
it chanced that Tommy was late for
school, and, rounding a corner hurriedly, ran
up against a big boy, who was sporting a
pansy in his buttonhole. The big boy, who
was Scotty&#8217;s son, immediately proceeded to
cuff him for his carelessness, and Tommy
retorted by &#8220;calling&#8221;<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_18" href="#en_18">[18]</a></span> his opponent and his
family connections with a ready profuseness.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
&#8216;Wey, even that pansy thoo&#8217;s sportin&#8217;
divvn&#8217;t belong thoo, nor thy feythor nowther,
it&#8217;s my dad&#8217;s growin&#8217;; he showed his ain
pansies as Scotty&#8217;s, &#8217;cos Scotty&#8217;s happened
an accident i&#8217; the cart. Feythor took them
up for yor mither, &#8217;cos thoo had forgottened
them, an&#8217; to save thoo a strappin&#8217;; an&#8217;
feythor&#8217;s pansy champion, and Scotty&#8217;s nowt
but a beer-barril!&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Liar!&#8217; responded the other boy, with a
punch of his fist.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ax yor mither, then,&#8217; shouted Tommy,
as he ducked and broke away from his
captor&#8217;s clutch.
</p>

<p>
A night or two after this encounter Geordie
was surprised by a visit from Scotty.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Whatten a tale&#8217;s this ye&#8217;re spreadin&#8217;
aboot o&#8217; yor showin&#8217; yoor pansies as mine,
I&#8217;d like to ken?&#8217; demanded the intruder
wrathfully.
</p>

<p>
Geordie looked up quietly from his book,
and: &#8216;I&#8217;ve spread no tales aboot thoo or thy
pansies,&#8217; he replied.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
&#8216;Weel, it&#8217;s either thoo or that wee, impittent
son o&#8217; yoors, Tommy. Noo, I&#8217;ve
been axin&#8217; my missus aboot it, an&#8217; she says
she did gie ye my pansies to tak&#8217; up to
the show wi&#8217; yoors; an&#8217; what I want to be
at is what i&#8217; the deil&#8217;s name ye did to them.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Geordie, in reply, exactly related what had
occurred.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Then, wey didn&#8217;t ye tell us aboot it?&#8217;
demanded Scotty, still dissatisfied.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Because thoo has a tarr&#8217;ble sharp tongue
i&#8217; thy mouth, an&#8217; I divvn&#8217;t want to be scandalized
aboot the village as one who would
sharp another for the sake o&#8217; winnin&#8217; a floo&#8217;er
prize.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Hum!&#8217; ejaculated Scotty, &#8216;it&#8217;s an extraordinar&#8217;
thing this! But hoo can ye explain
aboot the pansies, then? I&#8217;m pansy champion,
an&#8217; therefore thae pansies that win the prize
mun ha&#8217; been mine, yet here ye are sayin&#8217;
that they were yoors.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Geordie got up from his seat, and, without
immediately replying, went into the room at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the back, and came forth again bearing in his
arms a shattered green case.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Dis thoo recognise this?&#8217; he asked quietly,
as he set it down on the table in front of his
visitor.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay,&#8217; replied Scotty, after a minute inspection;
&#8216;it&#8217;s mine dootless. But what then?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Wey, then, thoo has my case, an&#8217; my
pansies inside ov it; an&#8217; here&#8217;s yors still left
i&#8217; their holes, just as they were on show-day.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Scotty bent over the broken lid incredulously,
lifted a faded specimen out, and regarded
it contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Na, na,&#8217; he asserted shortly, &#8216;that&#8217;s no
my pansies; mine were champions, an&#8217; these
is weeny things. Na, na, there&#8217;s been a bit
queer play about this. Maybe Tommy
changed them frae the one case to the
ither.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Tommy did nowt o&#8217; the sort,&#8217; retaliated
Geordie quickly. &#8216;Aal that was done was
to untie the label an&#8217; clagg (stick) it on to my
case instead o&#8217; yors.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
&#8216;Weel, it&#8217;s a dommed queer thing aaltegither,&#8217;
replied Scotty, pushing his cap
from his brow, &#8216;and beyont me; for I&#8217;m
champion, nobody can deny that, an&#8217; a
proper professor at floo&#8217;er growin&#8217;, an&#8217; ye&#8217;re
but an ammytoor, d&#8217;ye see? An&#8217; it&#8217;s just
surprising to me that ye could e&#8217;er imagine
ye could compete wi&#8217; me. But I divvn&#8217;t
wish to be ower hard on ye, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll e&#8217;en gie
ye the benefit o&#8217; the doot, as the saying is;
sae I&#8217;ll just send ye back yoor gun&#8212;that is,&#8217;
he continued slowly, eyeing Geordie wistfully,
&#8216;if ye&#8217;re wishfu&#8217; to ha&#8217; her back.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Thoo can keep her,&#8217; replied Geordie,
&#8216;for it&#8217;s nae use to me nowadays; but I
would like&#8212;I would be tarr&#8217;ble pleased if
thoo would come&#8212;&#8212;&#8217; Here he halted
abruptly, on a sudden fear lest Scotty&#8217;s suspicions
of some underhand play in regard to
the pansies might be again roused if he too
openly requested him to come to chapel.
</p>

<p>
The other hesitated a little. &#8216;Weel,&#8217; he
said finally, &#8216;it&#8217;s a canny wee gun, an&#8217; I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
would gey like to keep her. An&#8217; as for
chapel gangin&#8217;&#8212;for I suppose that&#8217;s what
ye&#8217;re after&#8212;if ye divvn&#8217;t blab aboot us, wey,
I&#8217;ll just tak&#8217; a look in noo an&#8217; again.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;That&#8217;s right, noo,&#8217; <a id="tn2">responded</a> Geordie
gratefully, and his deep-set eyes glowed with
a warmer light. &#8216;Shake hands on&#8217;t.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Scotty shook hands without demur and
swiftly departed, fearful lest Geordie might
regret the arrangement.
</p>

<p>
Geordie leant back in his chair and heaved
a sigh of relief as he offered up a silent
thanksgiving to Providence for having
softened Scotty&#8217;s heart.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It&#8217;s aal right noo,&#8217; he murmured. &#8216;Wi&#8217;
the help I&#8217;ve had from above I&#8217;ve catched
him at the finish, an&#8217; chapel will do the rest.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Thus for some time he reflected devoutly.
Then of a sudden a smile broke upon his lips
and he clapped his hand vigorously upon his
thigh. &#8216;By!&#8217; he exclaimed aloud, &#8216;but I&#8217;s
a proper Jesu-yte efter aal!&#8217;
</p>

<h2>&#8216;GEORDIE RIDE-THE-STANG&#8217;</h2>

<div class="blq">
<p>
The custom of &#8216;riding the stang&#8217; is now obsolete,
so that the date of this story must be put back a
number of years, though Mr. Brockett,<span id="fnanchor_19"><a id="fn_19" href="#en_19">[19]</a></span> writing in his
glossary of Northumbrian words, in the early part of
this century, says, &#8216;I have myself been witness to processions
of this kind. Offenders of this description are
mounted a-straddle on a long pole, or stang, supported
upon the shoulders of their companions. On this painful
and fickle seat they are borne about the neighbourhood
backwards, attended by a swarm of children huzzaing
and throwing all manner of filth. It is considered a
mark of the highest reproach, and the person who has
been thus treated seldom recovers his character in the
opinion of his neighbours.&#8217; The method of divination
by the puddings has been practised within living
memory, and even yet may be resorted to by way of
a jest upon occasion.
</p>

<p>
Since writing the above the author has come across
in Mr. R. Blakeborough&#8217;s interesting book, &#8216;Yorkshire
Wit, Character and Customs,&#8217; a different version of
&#8216;riding the stang,&#8217; to which he is indebted for the first
four lines of the &#8216;furrinor&#8217;s&#8217; song. In a footnote
Mr. Blakeborough adds that the &#8216;stang&#8217; was ridden at
Thoralby, Wensleydale, as recently as October, 1896.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
There was French blood in Geordie
Robertson&#8217;s wife, Mary, and it may
perhaps have been owing to her origin that
she was so eager for revenge when she
found herself deceived by her husband.
</p>

<p>
She had begun to suspect him of infidelity
even before a neighbour had given her a
hint that he had a &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife away in
Bridgeton, for her husband brought home
less and less with his &#8216;pack&#8217; after his weekly
tramp was over, and when she asked for
explanations he &#8216;called&#8217; her with most
abusive virulence.
</p>

<p>
For her further satisfaction she determined
to make trial, now that the pig was to be
killed, of the ancient method of divination
practised by the pit-wives, of which the
following is the ritual:
</p>

<p>
When the animal has been slaughtered
and the blood duly made into puddings, these
puddings are &#8216;set away&#8217; to boil by the
inquirer of the oracle. Then, just before
they are taken out of the &#8216;pot,&#8217; the officiating
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
priestess must say aloud that she &#8216;gives
them&#8217; to him who is suspected of infidelity.
Should the puddings emerge whole, gossip
is dumfoundered; should they come forth
broken, the man is proved to have a &#8216;fancy&#8217;
wife.
</p>

<p>
Mary, indeed, found she could scarcely
control her impatience when the fatal
day came, and, the pig duly slaughtered,
she &#8216;gave&#8217; the puddings to her husband,
Geordie.
</p>

<p>
She waited another minute to give the
spell the lawful grace, then with a trembling
hand plucked forth the puddings.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ah&#8212;ah!&#8217; she gasped, tremulous but
triumphant, &#8216;then it is so; he has a fancy
wife,&#8217; and her quick brain fell to pondering
a plan for discovery and revenge.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to be done was to lure her
&#8216;man&#8217; into a false security by subtle commiseration
with him on the &#8216;slackness&#8217; of
trade, as also by a wonderful submissiveness,
even to the extent of going without bacon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
for breakfast in order that she might save
enough to buy him tobacco. Now this form
of procedure with a selfish man usually
produces excellent results. If he is sufficiently
selfish, he does not stay to inquire
why or wherefore, but takes all he can, as
a cat her cream, without delay, without a
thank you&#8212;nay, unlike tabby, without even
an inward purr.
</p>

<p>
It was so with Geordie, who began incontinently
to brag about his &#8216;missus&#8217;s trainin&#8217;,&#8217;
and how he was &#8216;champion&#8217; at &#8216;fettlin&#8217; a
wife&#8217;s nonsense,&#8217; and, swollen with self-satisfaction,
began now to treat her with a sort of
contemptuous toleration.
</p>

<p>
A fortnight or so after Mary had made
trial of her puddings, Geordie carelessly
mentioned the fact that he would be away
over the &#8216;week-end&#8217; in and about Bridgeton,
and demanded some &#8216;brass&#8217; from her for the
replenishing of his &#8216;pack.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Outwardly submissive, she gave him five
shillings from her small savings, but inwardly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
determined that it was the last sum of money
he should have from her.
</p>

<p>
On Friday night Geordie departed gaily
for Bridgeton, and on the Saturday afternoon
Mary followed suit, clad in a thick
cloak which might serve her for a disguise
upon occasion.
</p>

<p>
When she arrived there, the main street
and market were thickly crowded with a
swarm of holiday-making pitmen, country
folk, farmers and their wives, hinds, male
and female, for it was the date of the annual
fair and hiring, of &#8216;the general assembly&#8217; of
tramps, pedlars, &#8216;tinklers&#8217; (tinkers), show-men,
and the like, whose business it is to
attend such gatherings.
</p>

<p>
In such a crowd Mary felt safe from
recognition, but it might be a difficult task
to discover her &#8216;man&#8217; in all that company.
</p>

<p>
An hour or two passed, and she had been
up and down the long street twice without
success; but just as she was turning into a
cheap refreshment-room, with &#8216;Tea and coffy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
always redy&#8217; written in a slovenly hand upon
a dirty placard in the window, she caught
the sound of a voice raised in semi-drunken
irritation close behind her which caused her
to turn her head hurriedly in that direction.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there he was without doubt, her
Geordie, heavy with liquor already&#8212;not
&#8216;mortal&#8217; yet, but quarrelsome. Aha! and
that was the &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife, of course, who
had him fast by the arm&#8212;a blousy, red-faced,
fat-armed, big chested woman, who
was evidently trying to persuade her charge
to come home much against his inclination.
At sight of her rival&#8212;immodest,
gross, overpowering&#8212;Mary shrank back
aghast, and it was only after a struggle with
herself and a forcible iteration of her wrongs,
that she could persuade herself slowly and
reluctantly to follow the couple in front of
her.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ho-way!&#8217; shouted Geordie; &#8216;there&#8217;s Tom
Turnbull ower by there tryin&#8217; ti lift weights
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
an&#8217; show &#8217;s strength. Wey, but Tom cannet
lift weights, he&#8217;s nowt but a wee bit beggor.
Tom, thoo beggor!&#8217; he challenged across the
intervening throng of heads, &#8216;thoo cannet
lift weights; wey, Aa&#8217;l lift weights wi&#8217; thoo
for a bottle o&#8217; whisky!&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ho-way, then, thoo aad fightin&#8217;-cock! but
Aa give thoo fair warnin&#8217; Aa can beat thoo,
for Aa&#8217;s champion.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
At this, the &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife seized her &#8216;man&#8217;
firmly by the sleeve, fearing doubtless lest,
in his then &#8216;muzzy&#8217; condition, Geordie would
waste the scanty remainder of his brass upon
a vain endeavour, and, by way of effectually
dissuading him, indiscreetly praised his rival&#8217;s
prowess.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;No, no, Geordie, my man, come this way,
an&#8217; give us my fairin&#8217;; wey, there&#8217;s a mort
o&#8217; things ti see yet; there&#8217;s the shuttin&#8217;-gall&#8217;ry,
an&#8217; the twa-headed cat, an&#8217; the giant,
an&#8217; the fat woman, an&#8217; aal&#8212;ho-way. Ay, an&#8217;
Geordie, hinny, Tom Turnbull&#8217;s tarr&#8217;ble
clivvor at liftin&#8217; they handles things an&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
drivin&#8217; the bolt up the stick wi&#8217; the hammer,
an&#8217; Aa&#8217;s warn&#8217;d but he&#8217;ll bang thoo at that
game.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Tom Turnbull!&#8212;that haalf-grown, bandy-legged
beggor ov a bit tailor ov a man bang
me? Gox! but Aa&#8217;ll larn him a lesson.
Aa&#8217;ll cut his comb, Aa&#8217;s warn&#8217;d!&#8217; and Geordie
forthwith, murmuring maledictions, thrust
blindly through the crowd till he reached
the spot where his rival stood, the centre
of an admiring circle of friends.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Noo,&#8217; cried Geordie, turning up his wrist-cuffs,
&#8216;Aa&#8217;ll show thoo hoo the thing&#8217;s done
when it&#8217;s done proper. Wey, this bolt &#8217;ll
hit the beam at the top when Aa gie the
stump a bat!&#8217; and without more ado&#8212;amidst
the jeers of some, and the encouragement of
a few false friends&#8212;he seized the hammer,
swung it round his head, and brought it
down some feet wide of the mark&#8212;smash
upon the cobble-stones of the market-place.
&#8216;That&#8217;s done the business!&#8217; cried Geordie
triumphantly, conscious from the stinging of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
his hands that he had &#8216;gi&#8217;en it a champion
bat,&#8217; and certain that he had driven up the
bolt some feet above his rival&#8217;s mark.
</p>

<p>
Through the roar of laughter, which
Geordie complacently accepted as the proper
accompaniment of Tom&#8217;s defeat, a voice
pierced suddenly with a shrill note as of
a fife.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Thoo great clumsy lubbert, see what
thoo&#8217;s done! Thoo&#8217;s broke the hammer&#8217;s
head off! That&#8217;s half a crown, my man, for
the hammer, an&#8217; a penny for the shot; an&#8217; if
thoo disn&#8217;t hand it ower, I&#8217;ll call the pollis,
for it&#8217;s fair takin&#8217; the livin&#8217; oot ov a poor
weeda woman&#8217;s mouth to break her hammer
thet fashion!&#8217; and a thin-faced female, with a
red-lined nose, sharp cheekbones, and watery
eyes, held up two skinny fists in anger against
him.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Gan on, woman, gan on!&#8217; retorted Geordie
indignantly; &#8216;wey, it&#8217;s thoo sh&#8217;d pay us, or
gie us a cigyar, or a cokienut; for that bat o&#8217;
mine hit the bull&#8217;s-eye, Aa&#8217;s warned.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
The shrill-voiced female renewed her protestations,
and some of the bystanders joined
in with additional explanations; but Geordie
would have none of them. &#8216;Gan on,&#8217; he
retorted; &#8216;gan awa home, an&#8217; wesh yor
feyce! Wey, the hammer&#8217;s as rotten as
pash, for Aa brought her fair doon like a pick
reet on top o&#8217; the stump. What else should
maa hands be tinglin&#8217; for?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
The proprietress of the hammer, however,
continued to assail Geordie with abuse, while
at the same time the &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife upon his
other side endeavoured to drag him away, so
that it need not surprise us if Geordie
suddenly lost his temper, and turned heavily
upon his tormentors.
</p>

<p>
He shook off the one, and flung down a
shilling in payment of the supposed damage
to the hammer; the other&#8212;the &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife&#8212;he
pushed roughly from him, with the
result that she lost her balance, and fell
whimpering in the mud, while Geordie
lurched off to the nearest hostelry, muttering
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
indignantly as he went, &#8216;Aa&#8217;s been fair
mucked ower wi&#8217; women the day&#8212;just fair
mucked ower.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
A swift inspiration gleamed in Mary&#8217;s
mind. For the punishment of Geordie she
had already made due preparation, and now,
if she could only persuade the &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife,
her triumph would be complete.
</p>

<p>
She noticed the woman angrily brushing
the muck off her &#8216;feast gown,&#8217; and at once
made her way up to her and touched her
gently on the arm. &#8216;Ay,&#8217; she said quietly,
as the other looked up with red and testy
face, &#8216;an&#8217; it&#8217;s the same way he treats me;&#8217;
holding her left hand loosely so that her
marriage-ring was plainly conspicuous.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;So he has a lawful wife, an&#8217; yore her?&#8217;
And the speaker gave a suspicious, all-embracing
stare. &#8216;Well,&#8217; she continued
slowly, jealousy slipping, like some slow
portcullis, from her eyes, &#8216;he&#8217;s had a change,
has my lord! Forst, it was a thin lass like
yorsel&#8217;, an&#8217; noo it&#8217;s a plump one like me.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Ay, he&#8217;s greedy, is Geordie; he winna be
content wi&#8217; the one, like Jack Spratt, but
wants both.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay, lass,&#8217; replied the other woman quietly,
&#8216;yore right: he&#8217;s greedy an&#8217; selfish. That&#8217;s
the sort&#8212;a selfish good-like nowt, that lives
on women, makes them keep him through life
just as one does a babby; an&#8217; he&#8217;s treated
the pair ov us shameful&#8212;just shameful; but,
hinny, I&#8217;ve a plan for a bit payment for him,
an&#8217; if ye come aside a bit wi&#8217; me, I&#8217;ll tell ye
o&#8217;t.&#8217; And she laid an appealing hand upon
the other&#8217;s, and affected with the disengaged
one to brush the remaining dirt from the
&#8216;fancy&#8217; wife&#8217;s skirt.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, what is&#8217;t?&#8217; said the latter, suffering
herself to be led through the crowd to a quiet
corner.
</p>

<p>
Mary at once proceeded, but with a cautious
self-effacement, to detail her schemes for
Geordie&#8217;s discomfiture. &#8216;It will not hurt
him,&#8217; she protested, as her rival still sat
silent, &#8216;but it will pay him a bit for the way
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he&#8217;s treated us&#8217;&#8212;here Mary&#8217;s hand again
occupied itself with the soiled dress&#8212;&#8216;and
it will give ye the laugh over him. I&#8217;ve done
wiv him mysel; I&#8217;m awa to France to-night
or morning&#8212;that&#8217;s where Grandfeyther was
bred; he came to these parts selling onions
at first, an&#8217; finally settled doon here to
&#8217;scape the soldierin&#8217;. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve money
enough to pay the expenses,&#8217; she continued;
&#8216;an&#8217; for suthin&#8217; to eat an&#8217; drink an&#8217; the
ticket.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
The &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife looked at her somewhat
hardly, suspicion rising to the surface of her
eye. &#8216;An&#8217; sae yore off to France, are ye?&#8217;
she queried; &#8216;ay, an&#8217; yore tired ov him?
Well, mevvies he would say as he was tired
o&#8217; thoo; but I&#8217;ve a grudge again&#8217; him for the
way he&#8217;s treat us to-day, spendin&#8217; aal my
brass ower himsel&#8217; an&#8217; clartin&#8217; my gown an&#8217;
all, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll pay him for&#8217;t, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d.&#8217; And
her face darkened vindictively.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;That&#8217;s right,&#8217; replied Mary swiftly. &#8216;And
now for the plan. Here&#8217;s money for you to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
treat him with. Get him awa oot o&#8217; the
public before he&#8217;s had too much, an&#8217; bring
him along wi&#8217; you by the last train from
Bridgeton, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll meet you wi&#8217; the &#8220;stang&#8221;
ready for him, an&#8217; the lads, an&#8217; the music, an&#8217;
all. Oh, but it&#8217;ll all gan fine, ye-es, ye-es!&#8217;
</p>

<p>
So Mary, having handed over all that she
could spare to her rival, departed for the
railway-station with a view to catching an
earlier train, and revising her preparations at
the other end.
</p>

<p>
Her elation was complete. The only
possible flaw in her subtly-devised plan lay
in the moods of the &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife. If Geordie
continued to treat her roughly&#8212;and as he had
now evidently settled down to the drink, he
was almost certain to do so&#8212;she would be
true to the arrangement; if not, she might
relent, and keep Geordie from his house that
night.
</p>

<p class="tb">
       *       *       *       *       *
</p>

<p>
The train was overdue, and Mary waited
with a feverish expectation at the station&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
descent amidst a small crowd of young men
and boys to whom the idea of making anyone
&#8216;ride the stang&#8217; had appealed with an
irresistible sense of novelty.
</p>

<p>
The custom, indeed, was obsolete, but all
had heard of it, and the older men had often
witnessed it in their youth, and some of them
had collected near the station to criticise and
superintend the performance.
</p>

<p>
The &#8216;stang&#8217; itself was in readiness&#8212;having
been lent to Mary on this occasion
by the schoolmaster and antiquary of the
village, whose father had been, as constable,
its custodian in the old days.
</p>

<p>
And now at last the rumble of an
approaching train was audible, and the group
at once assumed an alert and eager air.
</p>

<p>
A crowd of tired excursionists slowly
descended the narrow path from the station,
men and women together, but there was no
sign of Geordie or the &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife. Mary&#8217;s
heart grew heavy within her; after all, then,
she would have to depart without that sweet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
morsel&#8212;her revenge. The &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife
must have relented and informed Geordie of
her plans.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ho-way,&#8217; cried a man in her ear, &#8216;he&#8217;s not
comin&#8217; back the night; thoo&#8217;s gi&#8217;en him a
gliff mevvies.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Stay!&#8217; cried she swiftly, detaining him by
the arm. &#8216;What&#8217;s that, then?&#8217; she whispered
triumphantly, as at the tail of the procession
of pleasure-seekers a couple became visible
descending fitfully with wayward lurches.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;See there!&#8217; continued Mary eagerly, &#8216;it&#8217;s
Geordie an&#8217; his &#8220;fancy&#8221; wife with him.
Catch tight haud of him, an&#8217; mount him,
an&#8217; carry him through the length o&#8217; the
village on the &#8220;stang&#8221;&#8212;right to his very
door; he canna get in though, for I&#8217;ve the
key i&#8217; my pocket,&#8217; and Mary laughed with an
inward glee.
</p>

<p>
Down came the couple slowly, Geordie
abusing his companion, as he lurched against
her heavily, for not progressing with more
even footsteps, the woman saying nothing,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
but tightly gripping him by the arm, in order,
doubtless, to keep him upright and also to
prevent any attempt at escape.
</p>

<p>
The wicket-gate swung open, Geordie
lurched through, and in a moment he was
seized, hoisted into the air, a rough pole
thrust through his legs, and the triumphal
march began to the tune of a penny whistle,
played by the local champion, a carter to
trade, and a number of Jews&#8217; harps and toy
trumpets with which a herd of small boys
poured forth discordant revel.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Gox! Aa&#8217;s fallen intiv a sorcus (circus),&#8217;
cried Geordie, in the first moment of
astonishment, then, &#8216;Leave haud ov us, ye
great flamin&#8217; Irish&#8212;&#8212; What the devil&#8217;s
this Aa&#8217;s astride o&#8217;?&#8217; adding with solemn
dignity, &#8216;Yore makin&#8217; a tarr&#8217;ble mistake.
Aa&#8217;s not Blondin, ti walk on a tight rope for
ye; Aa&#8217;s Geordie Campbell o&#8217; the Raa (Row),
whe lives i&#8217; the hoos wi&#8217; the brass handle tiv&#8217;t.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay, ay, we knaa thoo!&#8217; cried the chorus
of urchins; &#8216;thoo&#8217;s Geordie, drunken Geordie,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Geordie wi&#8217; the &#8220;fancy&#8221; wife. Geordie,
Geordie ride-the-stang! Eh, what a clivvor
rider is Geordie! Thoo&#8217;s a proper jockey,
Geordie, an&#8217; thoo&#8217;ll mevvies ride the winner
i&#8217; &#8220;the Plate&#8221;<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_20" href="#en_20">[20]</a></span> before thoo&#8217;s finished wiv it.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
This idea tickled the carriers of the
&#8216;stang,&#8217; and Geordie&#8217;s bearers were forthwith
transformed into thorough-breds with a
tendency to buck-jump. Hither and thither
he rolled, dazed and bewildered, helplessly
clutching at the heads of those near him for
support, but his arms were seized, his legs
tightly crossed below the &#8216;stang,&#8217; and he
swung from side to side, while the rougher
boys, chanting rude doggerel over him,
gathered and threw mud upon him. A
trombone and a &#8216;sarpint&#8217; here joined the
noisy crowd, and to the varied strains of
&#8216;The Campbells are coming,&#8217; &#8216;Weel may the
keel row,&#8217; and &#8216;Canny Dog Cappie,&#8217; Geordie
was borne in triumph up the Row.
</p>

<p>
A &#8216;furrinor&#8217; (foreigner, stranger) here joined
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the medley, a &#8216;South countryman&#8217; from Yorkshire,
who, chancing to have lately come to
the village after some private experience of
his own in stang-riding in one of the remoter
Yorkshire vales, at once placed his services
at the crowd&#8217;s disposal.
</p>

<p>
Marching at the head of the procession,
like the drum-major of a band, and beating
together two saucepan-lids, he led the
anthem.
</p>

<p>
Between the &#8216;cling, cling, cling&#8217; of the
lids his voice rose lustily:
</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="verse">&#8216;Ah tinkle, ah tinkle, ah tinkle tang,</div>
  <div class="verse">It&#8217;s not foor your part nor mah part</div>
  <div class="verse">&#8217;At ah ride the stang,</div>
  <div class="verse">But foor you, Geordie Robertson, who his wife did bang.&#8217;</div>
</div>

<p>
Scarcely had he ended when the shrill
trebles of the boys took up the wondrous
tale, and in antiphony chanted their response:
</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="verse">&#8216;Up wiv a bump and down wiv a bang</div>
  <div class="verse">Gans Geordie, Geordie ride-the-stang;</div>
  <div class="verse">A bump an&#8217; a bang for his deed sae wrang,</div>
  <div class="verse">An&#8217; we&#8217;ll larn him a lesson for ever sae lang.&#8217;</div>
</div>

<p>
Then, to the full chorus, with complete
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
orchestra of flute and fife, trombone and
triangle, tin whistle and &#8216;sarpint,&#8217; brass pot,
pan, and saucepan-lids, the entire procession
moved slowly onward.
</p>

<p>
Mary&#8217;s eyes burned bright with exultation
as she marched along in the crowd, not
letting a single incident of the spectacle
escape her notice, and as she watched she
too joined in the chorus of &#8216;Geordie, Geordie
ride-the-stang&#8217; without restraint.
</p>

<p>
The sound of the familiar voice roused
the victim from the stupor into which the
hustling, peltings, and shoutings had reduced
him.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Thoo &#8212;&#8212;,&#8217; he yelled, as he caught sight
of her; &#8216;then it&#8217;s thoo that&#8217;s at the bottom
o&#8217; this? By, but if Aa wes free Aa&#8217;d&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;
But a stalk of cabbage thrown at a venture
by a small boy on the skirts of the crowd
here impeded his utterance, and Mary&#8217;s voice
rang out perhaps more triumphantly than
before.
</p>

<p>
The &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife, meanwhile, who had at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
first discreetly retired from public view
and looked on at the procession from a
distance, had shortly after joined the noisy
throng, moved thereto by a sense of isolation,
and also by a certain smouldering
compunction. She looked around her irresolutely;
she felt she had acted precipitately;
certainly she was not deriving any advantage
from the proceedings, whereas her rival was
the leader of the revelry, dancing, clapping her
hands, and carrying on like a &#8216;Maypole lass.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
At this moment Mary inadvertently
brushed against her, and in a moment the
&#8216;fancy&#8217; wife turned upon her like a spitfire.
Clenching her fists and shouting vituperations,
she tried to seize her by the hair.
Foiled in this by an adroit swerve of Mary&#8217;s
under the &#8216;stang,&#8217; she turned her fury upon
Geordie&#8217;s bearers, and with such success that
to defend themselves they were forced to
lower the pole to the ground. &#8216;Noo,
Geordie,&#8217; cried she, promptly thrusting the
wooden weapon into his hands, &#8216;mak&#8217; play
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
wiv it, my man, ho-way,&#8217; and Geordie, realizing
he was now free, lunged furiously in all
directions, and scattered the crowd like chaff
before him.
</p>

<p>
Steered by his &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife, a way grew
clear about them, and Geordie marched
slowly, unsteadily forward, bearing the
&#8216;stang&#8217; like a battering-ram straight in
front of him, down the remaining length of
the Row, accompanied at a respectful distance
by a rabble of the smaller urchins.
</p>

<p>
Right on past his house he went, out into
the darkness beyond, and over the bridge
at the end of the village, still tightly grasping
the &#8216;stang&#8217; himself, and tightly grasped in
his turn by his &#8216;fancy&#8217; wife.
</p>

<p>
The last train to Oldcastle happened to
pass above the bridge at that moment, and
a head leant far out through a carriage
window.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay!&#8217; a clear voice sounded, with a touch
of derision on the night air&#8212;&#8216;Ay! that&#8217;s
right, haud him tight, for he wants it badlies.&#8217;
</p>

<p class="pagenum-h-p"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<h2>YANKEE BILL AND QUAKER JOHN</h2>

<p>
Quaker John was one of the best
known figures in the small seaport
town of Old Quay. Short of stature, heavy
of tread, always quietly attired in a black suit,
which varied not in cut from year to year;
indeed, the same suit had once been known
to do duty for three years together, till his
wife one day, so &#8217;twas said, handed them over
to the chimney-sweep in mistaken identity.
You might have told that he was of Puritan
descent some yards away, but the &#8216;letter of
the law&#8217; in him had been softened down by
the kindly genius of the old-fashioned Quaker.
A genial twinkle lay in hiding at the back of
his steadfast eye, and a smile was always &#8216;at
heel&#8217; beside his big and honest mouth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
A broad and spectacled nose completed
the portrait of one in whom the harmlessness
as of a dove did not of necessity efface the
wisdom of the serpent. At least, so said
Yankee Bill, who read character &#8216;at sight&#8217;;
but then, Bill was a disciple of that cynical
logic which proclaims not only all priests to
be humbugs, but all men immersed in business
who make pretensions to piety to be
hypocrites or fools.
</p>

<p>
He had happened to pass along the street
one &#8216;fourth-day&#8217; morning as John came out
of the meeting-house, and overheard him
address a remark about business to a Quaker
friend at his side, and thereafter was merciless
in ridicule. &#8216;John&#8217;s patent incubator,&#8217;
he styled the meeting-house, &#8216;for plot-hatching,&#8217;
and pretended to be afraid of doing
business with him on Wednesday afternoons
for fear of being &#8216;skinned.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Bill was a waif from the seas who had
somehow been thrown up at Old Quay a few
years back, and having &#8216;prospected around&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and &#8216;pegged out a claim&#8217; for himself in the
indiscriminate region of commission business,
life insurance, advertising agencies, secretaryships,
and other nebulous formative processes,
was now almost as well-known a
figure in the town as Quaker John himself.
</p>

<p>
The chief foundation in any abiding friendship
is a certain diversity of temperament
which those who wondered at the mutual
liking that had sprung up between the retiring
stockbroker&#8217;s clerk and the worldly
Yankee had evidently overlooked. To John
the American&#8217;s audacity was a perpetual
delight, tempered by occasional Puritan
scruples as to whether he was justified in
associating with so hardened an unbeliever.
To Bill Coody the Quaker&#8217;s reposefulness
and quiet self-sufficiency were both a sleeping-draught
and irritant.
</p>

<p>
Nothing delighted him more than to get a
rise out of John; but John was hard to catch,
and even when craftily inveigled into a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
theological argument, was extremely chary
of entering into definite statements. Even
when his position was most hotly assailed
by the other, who made unsparing use of
the <i xml:lang="la">argumentum ad hominem</i>, reinforced by
a store of malicious anecdotes of religious
&#8216;professors&#8217; all the world over, John never
lost his temper, but mildly suggested that his
antagonist was an Anarchist in disguise.
</p>

<p>
John himself, though immersed in business
which some of the &#8216;plain people&#8217; have been
used to look askance at, lived after the simple
fashion of the straiter sect.
</p>

<p>
After his day&#8217;s work at the office, where as
head clerk much responsibility lay on his
shoulders, he would go straight home and
employ his leisure on fine days in his garden,
and on wet days in his library, for John
was not only a book-collector, but also a
reader.
</p>

<p>
One pipe of tobacco he allowed himself
before going to bed on week days and two
on &#8216;first-days,&#8217; and flavoured his tobacco with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
a chapter of &#8216;George,&#8217; as he styled in affectionate
intimacy his favourite author (Mr.
Meredith) on week-days, but a portion of
Barclay&#8217;s &#8216;Apology&#8217; on &#8216;first-day&#8217; evenings.
</p>

<p>
One evening John was sitting reading as
usual, when the maid-servant came in to say
that Mr. Coody wished to have a few words
with him. &#8216;Very well,&#8217; replied her master,
laying aside &#8216;George&#8217; with a sigh, and
wondering what business Bill might have on
hand to come at such an untimely hour.
</p>

<p>
In came his friend as unceremoniously as
ever, and, sitting himself down on the sofa,
drew vigorously at his cheroot for a minute
or two before entering upon the topic that
had brought him thither.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Look here, John,&#8217; he exclaimed all at
once, &#8216;you&#8217;re a confidential cuss, I guess,
and I&#8217;ve got a scheme on hand that will
&#8220;scoop the boodle&#8221; if properly carried out;
and what I want to know is, whether your
people will take a hand in it or no. It&#8217;s a
certain thing, and will go ahead like a runaway
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
buggy anyway; but the less friction the
better, so that if your people will grease the
wheels a bit, so much the better for them
and all consarned.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Tell me precisely what it is,&#8217; replied John
cautiously, &#8216;then I may be able to offer an
opinion; but, of course, I can&#8217;t say off-hand
whether the firm will entertain the idea or
not.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Waal,&#8217; replied Bill, &#8216;I guess you&#8217;re the
firm pretty often, for your bosses are generally
away huntin&#8217; or shootin&#8217; or foolin&#8217; around
somewhere; anyway, your advice is generally
listened to, I guess. Waal, to come to
business. I&#8217;m fixin&#8217; up a new store on the
most modern principles. I sell everything
cheaper than anybody else anywhere in this
little country of yours; any bloomin&#8217; thing
that&#8217;s asked for, why, it&#8217;s there, delivered free
to any part of the United Kingdom. Everybody
comes along&#8212;Noah&#8217;s Ark on a wet
day ain&#8217;t in it for the pushin&#8217; there&#8217;ll be at
our doors once we get opened out&#8212;and,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
another thing, everybody gets made into an
automatic shareholder; for profits have to
lie till they reach £5, when each man,
woman, and child gets a share given them,
will they, nill they&#8212;and you bet, John, they
will. I tell you, the thing&#8217;s fixed up, and is
goin&#8217; to give Old Quay shocks. Why, I&#8217;m
buyin&#8217; up here and there bankrupt stocks
enough to bust the place with&#8212;pianners,
hardware, bicycles, rose-trees, fam&#8217;ly Bibles,
rat-traps&#8212;every taste will be suited, for I
tell you cosmopolitanism ain&#8217;t in it with Bill
Coody. I tell you I&#8217;ll be in a position to
bust every single bicycle dealer in this little
one-hoss place; every pianner dealer can shut
up shop when I get started. Why, there
won&#8217;t be a pitman in Northumberland who
hasn&#8217;t got a demi-grand Eureka B. C. piano
in his house in another three weeks&#8217; time, and
every colliery village will have its Bayreuth
Festival with &#8220;Canny Dog Cappie&#8221; and
&#8220;Weel may the keel row&#8221; tinklin&#8217; away
down each row.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
&#8216;But think of the poor shopkeeper!&#8217; John
interrupted, aghast at this slaughter of the
innocents.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Now, John,&#8217; expostulated Bill, as one
who reproves a child for foolishness, &#8216;it&#8217;s not
&#8220;first-day,&#8221; and you ain&#8217;t &#8220;in meeting,&#8221; so
stick to business, if <em>you</em> please. Waal, the
thing&#8217;s got to go, as I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;, and the only
question is, are your people goin&#8217; to join in
or no? If not, I bust their little donkey
go-cart of Supply Stores which they set up
a few years back in South Street &#8220;for the
mutual encouragement of thrift and the supply
of the best articles at first-hand cost&#8221; as the
prospectus says, combinin&#8217; philanthropy and
five per cent, plus their commission on floatin&#8217;
the shop. Now, I know how much they
have in it, your bosses. J. B. has 10,000
shares, and young T. he has 5,000 out of a
total of 30,000, so they&#8217;re the largest shareholders
in the concern, but Bill Coody has
shares in it, too, John, he or his nominees.
Likely you&#8217;ve noticed the shares have been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
jumpin&#8217; up a bit lately and been wonderin&#8217;
what the jooce was up, eh?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Yes,&#8217; responded John quietly, endeavouring
to conceal any disquietude he might feel;
&#8216;yes, I&#8217;ve noticed that.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Waal, we&#8217;ve got enough to bust their
shop up pretty well, and if your people don&#8217;t
come into my showyard I&#8217;ll give their shares
away with a pound of tea,&#8217; and here he pulled
out a handful of certificates from his trousers&#8217;
pocket and flourished them in John&#8217;s face,
which was gradually growing longer as the
other unrolled his arguments.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;But how did you get the necessary
capital?&#8217; John inquired after a pause, professional
curiosity piqued at this unexpected
revelation of means.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Waal,&#8217; replied the American, as he carelessly
lit another cheroot, expectorating with
relish into John&#8217;s carefully-trimmed fire, &#8216;I&#8217;ll
tell you straight out, for I&#8217;m one of them
that goes straight to the point&#8212;fibbin&#8217; ain&#8217;t
in it with truthfulness, and bluffin&#8217;s no good
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
when the cards are on the table. Waal, I
bank with the Old Bank here, and decent
enough people they are, too, but a trifle slow,
so no sooner did the Joint Stock Bank open
out a new branch in Old Quay than in I go,
and I says, &#8220;Look here, boss, I want £5,000
of the ready, and I&#8217;ll bring you business,&#8221; I
says. Well, the boss rubs his hands in
butter, and he says, &#8220;Sartinly, sartinly,
Mr. Coody, we know your name well, sir;
most happy to oblige, I&#8217;m sure, and much
obliged if you could introduce us to a few of
your friends,&#8221; so after a bit more palaver and
a deposit of some shares the deal&#8217;s done.
Waal, down the street goes Bill Coody, and
into the parlour of the Old Bank, and says
to the partners straight out: &#8220;Now, look
here, gentlemen, there&#8217;s no beatin&#8217; about the
bush with me, and no frivolity in matters of
business, and what I want is £5,000 straight
down, which is the figure I&#8217;ve just been
offered by the new Joint Stock Bank over
the way. Now I like your style,&#8221; I says,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
&#8220;and I should be sorry to leave you; but
sentiment&#8217;s not my style of doin&#8217; business,
so there you have it.&#8221; Waal, the old gentleman
looked at me over his spectacles, same
way as you do, John, and under his spectacles
also, and offers me a pinch of snuff, while he
and his partner waggle their heads together
in a far-off corner of the room. Waal, after a
bit more palaver and a little &#8220;pi&#8221; jaw thrown
in gratis about the evils of speculatin&#8217;, and
a hope that a strange bank will not interfere
with mutual friendly business relations, that
deal&#8217;s done, and Bill Coody has £10,000 to
draw upon by feedin&#8217;-time that morning.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Waal, John, I think you&#8217;ll have the hang
of it now, and will be able to advise your
bosses as to what&#8217;s best for them and the
community, too, at large, and I want an
answer&#8212;a regular business-like document&#8212;signed,
sealed, and delivered, by this time
to-morrow night, for there&#8217;s a shipload of
my goods in already and lyin&#8217; at the quay,
and I can&#8217;t let the thing dry-rot while two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
thickheads worry the situation out and try
to tinker up a mind between them. So fix
it up for them, John, yourself. Ta-ta; I
must be off. There&#8217;s a chap waitin&#8217; for me
at the club on business.&#8217; And rising as
he spoke, he went as unceremoniously as
he came, leaving a trail of rank tobacco
that was as penetrating to John&#8217;s nostrils
as his communications had been to his intellect.
</p>

<p>
John lit his pipe again, which had gone
out as he listened to Bill&#8217;s scheme, and
thought for a while how &#8216;George&#8217; would have
dealt with the situation; how his penetrating
intellect would have pierced through Bill&#8217;s
armour-plating, and revealed the naked
artificer within.
</p>

<p>
Ah! if &#8216;George&#8217; had only been there for
five minutes, several of the questions that
were troubling him might have received
instant solution. He could not feel certain
how far Bill meant business with his store.
It was not all bluff, of course; but how much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of it was bluff, how much business, he could
not of himself determine.
</p>

<p>
It might be that he wanted to be bought
off at a price, or be offered a post upon the
directorate, or was merely a &#8216;bull&#8217; of the
shares. However, one thing was certain:
there must be no shilly-shallying. Either
Bill must be squared or he must be defied.
</p>

<p>
That was the question for him to determine.
No doubt, from a strictly business
point of view, the chief matter to be considered
was which of the two courses was
likely to prove most beneficial to his principals;
but the thought of the poor shopkeepers
was present in John&#8217;s mind, and operated
largely in influencing his mind in the direction
of defiance. There was poor old Mrs. S&#8212;&#8212;,
for example, who kept herself and two grandchildren
on the proceeds of a small florist&#8217;s
business, once her son-in-law&#8217;s. What would
happen to her if Bill were to flood the town
with rose-trees at a shilling the dozen?
</p>

<p>
To-morrow was Saturday, and Bill demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
an answer by the evening. The
next day being &#8216;first-day,&#8217; he would have to
satisfy his conscience&#8212;that &#8216;still small voice&#8217;
which, even in the silence of the meeting,
interrogated him severely on his dealings
during the past week, and permitted no
subterfuge or evasive answer&#8212;and it was
useless to think he could do so by pleading
that he was only a subordinate, not an official,
in this affair of the store. Well, so be it.
It must be defiance, then&#8212;war to the knife&#8212;if
Bill was in earnest; for to offer to put him
on the directorate of the supply stores would
merely mean setting up Bill&#8217;s store under the
old title.
</p>

<p>
John sat late as he pondered over the
situation. Suddenly one of the Articles of
Association of the stores flamed within the
chamber of his brain, and a twinkle shone in
his eye, as he reflected that it should enable
him to mate Bill&#8217;s cleverness at the very
outset.
</p>

<p>
Bill had quoted from the prospectus, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
he had evidently overlooked the Articles of
Association, and John chuckled to himself
delightedly as he recalled Article 5.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after seven next morning John
might have been observed taking the air
upon the quay, casting shrewd glances as
he passed along. He had some suspicions
concerning the amount of value of Bill&#8217;s consignment
of pianos, family Bibles, etc., and
he thought he might possibly discover something
for himself if he saw what vessels were
lying at the quay.
</p>

<p>
There was a green-hulled brigantine from
Norway lying alongside, but she was full of
battens and pit-props; a steam-collier lay
next, but she must simply be waiting there
for stores or sailing orders. A tramp came
next, apparently from America, by the labels
on some of her packages that the cranes were
already swinging overhead.
</p>

<p>
This, then, must be Bill&#8217;s consignment, for
there was nothing else in the river or at the
quay that John could see that could possibly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
have anything on board for Bill or his
stores.
</p>

<p>
As he stood there immersed in thought,
a figure appeared on the deck above him,
and, leaning his arms on the taffrail, regarded
the scene below him with a gloomy air. &#8216;The
skipper,&#8217; thought John, as he noted his blue
broadcloth and peaked cap, and on the spur
of a sudden inspiration immediately accosted
him.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Fine morning, captain. I happen to have
heard a rumour to the effect that you were
wanting an offer for your cargo. If so, I
might possibly get you an offer from a friend
of mine&#8212;at a reasonable figure, of course.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Waal,&#8217; replied the other slowly, &#8216;I guess
I&#8217;m ready for a deal, as the consignees are
bust up, and only 25 per cent. of the freight
paid for; but it&#8217;s not a knock-out, I tell ye,
for I&#8217;ve had a bid already for the lot.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Was it from a man they call Bill Coody,
by any chance?&#8217; asked John, with a fine
carelessness.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
&#8216;Waal,&#8217; replied the skipper, as he turned
his quid, &#8216;his name&#8217;s nothin&#8217; to me, so long
as he has the ready. Mr. Cash is the gent I
do business with; but if my memory sarves
me right, I think Bill Coody was the name
on his pasteboard.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;What precisely is the cargo?&#8217; queried
John. &#8216;Is it dry-store goods&#8212;organs, pianos,
and such like commodities?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay, that&#8217;s about what it is&#8212;all the sort
o&#8217; fixin&#8217;s that make a harmonious home for
the retired commercial gent&#8212;organs, melodeons,
brick-a-bacs, articles of virtoo and
amusement combined; and a fine variety of
wood goods besides. Waal, if you&#8217;re for a
deal you must be sharp about it, for I&#8217;ve to
fix up with Mr. Coody by ten o&#8217;clock this
mornin&#8217;, and I leave again this afternoon,
havin&#8217; just signed a fresh charter party for a
cargo of fireclay bricks. So name your figure,
plank down the cash, and I&#8217;m ready to deal.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, what did Mr. Coody offer you?&#8217;
asked John pertinently.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
&#8216;Three hundred pounds in bank notes,&#8217;
replied the skipper; &#8216;but I&#8217;ll take £400 to
clear; and dirt cheap, too, when you think
o&#8217; what a nest o&#8217; nightingales your fam&#8217;ly
and friends will be at ten dollars a head.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Thank you,&#8217; said John, as he moved
away; &#8216;I&#8217;ll just go round and have a talk
with my friend, and will let you know the
result before ten o&#8217;clock.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Right,&#8217; replied the captain, cutting himself
a fresh plug of tobacco; &#8216;£400 down, coin
o&#8217; the realm, before ten, mind ye, and your
friend&#8217;s set up for life with a &#8220;house
beautiful&#8221; that Solomon in all his glory and
Mrs. Sheba couldn&#8217;t have fixed up better
between them.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;What a curious, profane, hard-featured
set of men these Americans are!&#8217; thought
John, as he stepped briskly away in the
direction of his senior partner&#8217;s house.
&#8216;Why, the mind of that skipper is exactly
of the same temper as Bill&#8217;s; his features
are as irregular, even his voice has the same
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
twanging, nasal habit. However, he means
business evidently, and I think I can persuade
Mr. William to buy up his cargo,
which will put, I imagine, a pretty stiff spoke
in Bill&#8217;s wheel.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Within a quarter of an hour John was on
Mr. William&#8217;s doorstep, and ten minutes
afterwards was explaining the strategical
position to the senior partner in his dressing-gown.
&#8216;Certainly, John,&#8217; said Mr. William
slowly, after listening attentively to John&#8217;s
recital; &#8216;we couldn&#8217;t possibly have Coody
on our Board; it wouldn&#8217;t do at all. Why,
he&#8217;s a mere adventurer, and his method of
under-cutting, &#8220;busting&#8221; people up, etc., would
bring discredit upon our firm and have a bad
effect upon our business. No, it&#8217;s quite
evident, John, as you say, that we can&#8217;t
square him&#8212;as to how far he means business,
I don&#8217;t know. I incline to think he is bluffing
us; but there isn&#8217;t time to find out how much
he has up his sleeve; and if we buy up this
cargo we trump his ace, you think, and can
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
make a profit out of it ourselves at the stores
after? Well, I daresay you&#8217;re right, John;
and, after all, £400 won&#8217;t ruin us. We buy
his cargo, and as he can&#8217;t &#8220;bear&#8221; the shares,
he&#8217;ll be like a chained dog showing his teeth,
but doing no damage. Yes, I think it is an
excellent idea, John,&#8217; Mr. William said in
conclusion, &#8216;and if you&#8217;ll wait one minute I&#8217;ll
give you the cheque for £400.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
By ten o&#8217;clock that morning John had
completed his defences; the cargo was
bought; he held an indemnity against any
claims from the skipper and owners of the
goods in question; he had made an inquiry
at the Old Bank, and now was sitting down
at the office to write a short note marked
&#8216;private&#8217; to Bill, to tell him it was to be &#8216;war
to the knife.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;And I may tell thee, Bill, that thee had
better give in with a good grace; for, in the
first place, thee cannot sell the shares below
par&#8212;<i xml:lang="la">vide</i> the Articles of Association, paragraph 10&#8212;and,
in the second, we have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
bought up thy cargo; and, finally, I feel
assured that stores managed on thy suggested
lines would never bring a blessing with them.
Thou saidst it was to be &#8220;war to the knife,&#8221;
but we hope thee will think better of it, for
thy sake more than for our own,&#8217; and with a
friendly warning John finished his letter, and
despatched it by hand to &#8216;William Coody, Esq.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Late that afternoon, just as John was
leaving the office, a letter was brought to
him in Bill&#8217;s handwriting. It ran as follows:
</p>

<div class="blq2">
<p>
&#8216;Ta-ta, John, I&#8217;m off, you quaint, cocked-hat
old Puritan Precisian; but I couldn&#8217;t
leave without having tried a fall with you
first, and, on totting it up, I think Bill
Coody&#8217;s just had a trifle the best of the
mêlée. If I&#8217;d got on to the stores, I&#8217;d have
stayed in this derned little one-hoss place,
but those all-fired articles<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_21" href="#en_21">[21]</a></span> upset that cart.
</p>

<p>

I&#8217;ll allow you that, John; but I have you,
my boy, over that little cargo of mine.
Why, the whole show was a got-up job, the
cargo saw-dust, salvage stocks worth £20 at
an outside figure. The skipper, being a pal
of mine, lent me his duds, this morning, for I
knew you&#8217;d be down there sniffing and
spectacling about with the morning&#8217;s sunrise,
and I had the show ready for you, John, to
walk into, and in you walked like blue blazes.
The £400 will about pay for my trouble, and
for the premiums on the store shares. Your
principals will have to buy the shares back
from the banks&#8212;they mustn&#8217;t buy below par,
though, John&#8212;you remind them of that.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I&#8217;ve sold my biz., and am off with my pal,
the skipper, this moment. No time to handshake.
Ta-ta, John, and bear no malice.
Stick to piety and 5 per cent., and don&#8217;t buy
up bankrupt cargoes, and you&#8217;ll be Lord
Mayor of Old Quay before you&#8217;re finished.
So long, your pardner,
</p>

<h2>THE PROTÉGÉ</h2>

<p>
The Vale of the Frolic in the far west of
Northumberland had always been a
favourite retreat of mine. As I trudged the
London pavements in the dog-days before
the Law Courts rose, my heart panted for
the green hills and the sweet silences of
remotest Frolicdale.
</p>

<p>
The chiefest charm of the vale perhaps for
me lay in the fact that it was a track untrodden
by the tourist, resembling the maid
of the waters of Dove in this&#8212;that it was
one which, as yet, there were &#8216;few to know,
and very few to love.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
It was a pastoral, sheep-raising countryside,
inhabited by shepherds almost entirely,
who were at the same time farmers also, for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
their tenure was something after the <span xml:lang="fr">métayer</span>
order.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing to mar the quaint and
antique flavour of existence. The post, like
our lifeboat institution, was here supported
by voluntary contributions. If anyone were
&#8216;gannin&#8217; up the wattor,&#8217; well and good; he
would take the letters with him. If not,
then they were left at the schoolmaster&#8217;s till
called for. Newspapers, again, with the
exception of a weekly <cite>Courant</cite> or a <cite>Scots
Mail</cite>, were, like the woodcock, but &#8216;occasional
visitors&#8217; in that region; and when it is added
that the house I usually stayed at was situated
eighteen miles from a terminus of
a slow branch line of the North British
Railway Company, it will be evident that the
ordinary tourist had a very poor chance of
putting in an appearance in that favoured
region.
</p>

<p>
I was recalling all these little details with
infinite gusto as I sat down at my desk to
write to my friend the Presbyterian minister
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and schoolmaster of Fair-Green Haugh,
suggesting a visit from myself a week
ahead.
</p>

<p>
The answer came just in time for me to
pack up and start within the week.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I am sorry to say,&#8217; wrote my friend in
conclusion, &#8216;that my accommodation is somewhat
limited this summer, as I have had to
give up my small sanctum to a protégé of
mine, who, though he has just been discharged
from gaol, will yet, I feel assured, become a
highly useful and respectable member of
society.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I know your kind heart, my friend,&#8217; he
continued, &#8216;and feel sure you will not regret
a temporary lack of comfort in so good a
cause. You can always use the schoolroom,
as it is holiday time, for reading, writing and
smoking.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Heavens!&#8217; I murmured to myself, as I
took in the monstrous situation; &#8216;fancy
having to spend my vacation trying to
improve an infernal burglar! He knows
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
my kind heart, he says. Well, it only
proves the truth of the poet&#8217;s lines:
</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="verse">&#8216;&#8220;Not e&#8217;en the dearest heart, and next our own,</div>
  <div class="verse">Knows half the reasons why we smile or cry.&#8221;</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
I wonder,&#8217; I soliloquized, &#8216;whether he is
of the heavy, hang-dog, dropped-jaw type&#8212;the
knifing variety, in brief&#8212;or the other
species&#8212;the shifty-eyed, chinless, quick but
evil brained sort. On the whole, I prefer the
first, for if he cannot control his temper, at
any rate you know where you are with him,
whereas with the latter you never can tell
what he may be up to.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it was exasperating, for here had
I been congratulating myself upon the sweet
security of my proposed retreat, only to discover
at the last moment that I was destined
to become co-warder of a criminal.
</p>

<p>
However, it was no use making myself
miserable before the time, and as I was at any
rate now free from the choking London atmosphere
I could revel in the thought of fresh
country air, liberty and leisure.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
I stayed the night at Heathtown (famous
for the church wherein Bernard Gilpin, &#8216;the
apostle of the north,&#8217; stayed the hot Borderers
from feud), and, drawing the heather-honeyed
air deep into my lungs, felt my strength so
renewed that the thoughts of shifting the
ticket-of-leave gentleman if he didn&#8217;t, in
North-country phrase, &#8216;keep a civil tongue
in his heid and behave hissel&#8217; respectable,&#8217;
positively inspired me with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
The postman in his cart was, as it chanced,
going up to the little village, styled a &#8216;toon,&#8217;
where the last post and telegraph-office this
side of Scotland is situated, and insisted upon
giving me a &#8216;cast&#8217; so far upon my road.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;No, nowse is changed ava,&#8217; he replied, in
answer to my query, &#8216;syne ye were last here,
save belikely that we are aal a year older, an&#8217;
that Farmer Newton&#8217;s missus was brought
tae bed wi&#8217; anither bairn a month ago last
Saterday. Ye&#8217;ll mind she had her fourth
bairn the last time ye were here, an&#8217; Farmer
Newton, he says he&#8217;ll just hae tae turn priest,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
an&#8217; get the Sixstanes livin&#8217;,<span class="fnanchor"><a id="fn_22" href="#en_22">[22]</a></span> an&#8217; there, ye ken,
the Queen sends ye a ten-pound note for
every addition tae yor fam&#8217;ly; an&#8217; though
there might not be ower muckle profit in it,
it wud help tae keep the pot a-boiling, says
he. But I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; mysel&#8217;,&#8217; continued my
informant reflectively, &#8216;that if Farmer Newton
were tae give up shootin&#8217; an&#8217; huntin&#8217; sae
muckle, an&#8217; took a turn at farmin&#8217;, he&#8217;d have
a less reason for complaining.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
And so we passed the time away, he
regaling me with all the domestic gossip of
the countryside, I interrupting him now and
again to point out the historical objects of
interest on either hand of us; for, like all
true countrymen, though he knew every
stick and stone by the wayside, he was
entirely ignorant of the past history of his vale.
</p>

<p>
We were now close on the village where
my driver ended his stage, and it suddenly
occurred to me to inquire, as I thanked him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
for his kindness to myself, if he knew anything
of my friend&#8217;s protégé at the Fair
Green Haugh.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well,&#8217; he replied slowly, &#8216;I have heard as
hoo he has ta&#8217;en up wi&#8217; a convick or gaol-bord
o&#8217; that description. Wey, I canna tell. He&#8217;d
muckle better hae getten&#8217;d hissel&#8217; marrit; an&#8217;
sartinly we divvn&#8217;t want that sort o&#8217; specie
up this wattor-side. We hevn&#8217;t muckle gear
belike, but we prefer tae keep wor ain. He&#8217;ll
be ain o&#8217; the lifting kind likelies, the same
as thae moss-troopin&#8217; fellers ye were crackin&#8217;
on aboot enoo whae divvn&#8217;t seem ivvor tae
hae heard on the fifth commandment. Ye&#8217;ll
be weel employed this holiday-time o&#8217; yors
wi&#8217; lookin&#8217; efter him, I&#8217;s warn&#8217;d. But yo&#8217;re
a lawyer chap,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;an&#8217; dootless
ye&#8217;ll find an excuse tae shift him wi&#8217;. Put on
yor wig, an&#8217; nae doot but it will tarrify him.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
I thanked the speaker for his advice somewhat
ruefully, for his words exactly fitted my
own presentiment.
</p>

<p>
Having bade adieu to my postman friend,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and arranged for my heavier luggage to be
sent forward in the next carrier&#8217;s cart that
might be going &#8216;up the wattor,&#8217; I set out
across the hills to The Nook on Fair Green
Haugh with my knapsack on my back.
</p>

<p>
Two hours&#8217; walking brought me within
view of The Nook, and as I paused at the
top of the brae to drink in the well-beloved
aspect of the small &#8216;bigging&#8217; that sheltered
in the green coign between Windy Law and
Blind Burn side, I noticed the figure of a
man carrying a small child in his arms.
</p>

<p>
I knew most of the inhabitants of the vale
by sight, but the aspect of the individual in
question was unknown to me. It was scarcely
likely he could be a shepherd&#8217;s extra hand,
for the washing and shearing time was over,
and a tramp in the ordinary sense of the
term would have been, to quote from the
ornithologists, a &#8216;rare and occasional visitor.&#8217;
Besides, he had not the appearance of a
tramp; he walked with an easy boldness,
apparently playing with the child as he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
strolled, for as I drew nearer I could hear
the child&#8217;s voice gleefully crying, &#8216;Again,
again; do it again, funny man.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
As I drew nearer I looked at the stranger
with interest, and noted that he was a well-made,
active fellow, of good proportions.
His face was slightly scarred, as though from
small-pox, but not unpleasantly; it was as if
the disease, suddenly repenting of spoiling a
bright and healthful countenance, had incontinently
left him for another victim.
</p>

<p>
His eyes blue, his teeth, splendidly regular,
were clean and white as a hound&#8217;s. Glancing
at the child, I discovered her to be Maggie,
the six-year-old child of Tom Hedley, the
herd at Fulhope Law, so I went straight up
to her and asked for a kiss as usual. &#8216;No,&#8217;
said the diminutive flirt archly, holding her
head backwards; &#8216;no kiss for zoo. I&#8217;s got
a new man noo,&#8217; and forthwith she buried
her curls in his neck. &#8216;He&#8217;s a nice funny
man,&#8217; she continued in another moment,
peeping forth from her hiding-place, &#8216;an&#8217;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
he&#8217;s got nae mair hair on his heid than oor
little puppy-dog at home.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
I glanced at her captor, and noting his
cropped crown, jumped to a sure conclusion
as to his identity. &#8216;Why, &#8217;tis none other,&#8217;
thought I, &#8216;than the protégé.&#8217; Possibly he
read my thoughts; at any rate, releasing one
arm, he lifted his hand to a salute, smiling,
meanwhile, in the most affable way in the
world. I nodded &#8216;Good afternoon,&#8217; and
learning that the minister was within and
waiting my arrival, turned my steps to the
house.
</p>

<p>
After our first greetings were over he
commenced to apologize again for the limited
space at my disposal, but he was certain that
when once I had got to know his &#8216;protégé,&#8217;
I should think no more about it. &#8216;He is
a beautiful character,&#8217; he concluded enthusiastically,
&#8216;one could tell that at a glance
by the way in which children take to him.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I met him outside just a moment ago,&#8217;
I replied, &#8216;and he certainly seems to have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
won little Maggie&#8217;s heart, but from my recollection
of her half a dozen &#8220;sweeties&#8221; would
explain that feat. And after all,&#8217; I continued
judicially, &#8216;some of the greatest ruffians that
ever lived were extremely fond of children.
There was Herod, of course, but he was the
exception that proves the rule.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ah,&#8217; sighed my friend, &#8216;that terrible
London atmosphere! How it cankers the
human affections! The theory of the law,
I believe, is that every man should be considered
innocent till he has been proved
guilty; but you lawyers, reversing this in
practice, hold every man guilty till he prove
his innocence.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;How about his hair?&#8217; I inquired rather
unkindly.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;His hair?&#8217; my friend queried, with a
puzzled expression. &#8216;Oh, I see what you
mean,&#8217; he continued almost immediately, endeavouring
to shed a <i xml:lang="fr">soupçon</i> of a smile over
his seriously earnest countenance. &#8216;But
don&#8217;t notice that, please, or you may make
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
him reckless. For now is the critical time,&#8217;
he added solemnly, with the professional
manner of a physician making his diagnosis;
&#8216;if he gets safely over this his cure may be
regarded as practically assured.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The great thing is to believe in a man,
to cultivate little by little his sense of self-respect;
by &#8220;believing men to be better than
they are,&#8221; one may even, as has been so
well said, &#8220;make them better than they are.&#8221;
In England we have always gone on a
wrong principle; we worship success, worldly
success, far too much, and have scant sympathy
with the unfortunate. My friend
outside says that he stole a leg of mutton
for his starving daughter. The result is he
cannot now get a situation, and his daughter
has been taken from him, and is now in
a home. Well, if the man be treated with
contumely, he may very likely despair and
give up all hope of improvement. Treat
him well, on the other hand, and you may
yet turn him into a useful citizen.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
&#8216;You put a premium on wrong-doing,&#8217;
said I, as I shook my head at his argument,
smiling, however, at the impassioned face
before me.
</p>

<p>
His high, narrow forehead with the ruffled
upstanding hair betrayed the enthusiast; the
broad, refined, and eager lips marked a
perennial emotion within; his eyes, notwithstanding
their wonderful clarity, had a far-away
look in the depths of them; a spare
form, thin wrists, and shrunken hands completed
the presentation of the idealistic,
mystical, Don Quixote type of human nature.
</p>

<p>
While I thus reflected, my friend continued
to pour out fresh instances proving satisfactorily
to any non-prejudiced mind the
correctness of his theory.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;But what are you going to do with him?&#8217;
I asked eventually, &#8216;for after all that is the
important thing. I mean, his being here
with you may be very nice for him, but
it doesn&#8217;t teach him a trade, and you can&#8217;t
afford to keep him, I know, for long.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
&#8216;First of all,&#8217; eagerly began my friend,
&#8216;I propose to keep him long enough to
re-instate him in his self-respect; secondly,
to study his temperament and character
thoroughly in order to discover what line
of life he is best suited for, and then to get
him some appropriate situation. That is the
programme, and, I think, a quite practical
and satisfactory one. There is no &#8220;pauperizing&#8221;
here, you see; it is simply giving a
man a fair chance. And now,&#8217; he continued
briskly, &#8216;come out and inspect the
garden.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
The protégé, it appeared, had been making
himself useful therein, which my friend
thought was a highly encouraging sign,
&#8216;for,&#8217; said he, &#8216;no bad man ever cared for
gardening.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
The next few days I spent contentedly
in absolute idleness, now strolling up the
waterside, now smoking and reading peacefully
in the little arbour behind the herbaceous
border. I had almost forgotten the existence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of my <i xml:lang="fr">bête-noir</i>; he showed, indeed, a most
commendable readiness to efface himself as
much as possible from observation, and when
I chanced to pass him he seemed rather to
avoid me than to seek my company. &#8216;Good-morning,&#8217;
I would say, if I happened to
come out of the house before breakfast for
a stroll, and find him chopping firewood,
&#8216;lovely weather, and looks like lasting, I
think.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ay,&#8217; he would usually reply, with a hurried
touch to his cap, &#8216;it&#8217;s canny weather,&#8217; then
muttering something about being busy, would
incontinently hurry into the house. I took
this as a sign of grace, and was quite favourable
to the mode of intercourse thus established.
But my host, I could see, was pained
at my apparent lack of interest in his protégé;
so the next day, finding Blythe engaged in
tying up the suckers of the honeysuckle to
the trellis of the arbour, I went boldly up
to him, determined to try and draw him
out.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
&#8216;Well, and how do you like the country?&#8217;
I inquired. &#8216;A pleasant change after town
life, eh?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
He gave me a quick, suspicious glance in
return, then muttering, &#8216;Ay, dootless,&#8217; again
devoted himself to his occupation.
</p>

<p>
I tried again, but, meeting with no encouragement,
became, I am bound to confess,
a little nettled, as though with an insubordinate
witness. The happy insouciance
I thought to have marked in him at our first
encounter had vanished, and &#8216;&#8217;Tis the knifing
variety, after all,&#8217; I murmured to myself, and
fell to scrutinizing him somewhat severely.
There was something about him that somehow
seemed familiar to me. I determined to
probe, and see if he would wince.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Possibly you don&#8217;t care about the country?&#8217;
I suggested smoothly; &#8216;towns, perhaps,
attract you more. York, for example, is a
nice town, and, by chance, say September 30
for a little business in the vicinity, eh?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
He looked me full in the face at this, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
very ugly smile curving his lips, as he replied
abruptly, &#8216;What is it you&#8217;re wanting?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I don&#8217;t know that I want anything for
myself,&#8217; said I, somewhat elated at the success
of my conjecture, &#8216;but I should like fair play
for my friend inside. Pheasants are scarce
hereabouts, but possibly other things might
come in useful. I needn&#8217;t specify,&#8217; I continued
airily, &#8216;to a gentleman of your intelligence;
&#8217;twould be superfluous.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
For reply he made a bound at me, head
down, and both fists outstretched. It was as
the rush of the bull for the matador&#8217;s flag,
and my bound aside just saved me from his
charge, though his right fist touched me on
the chest and sent me staggering backward.
</p>

<p>
He turned, and came again; this time I
had more space for man&#339;uvre, and the
memory of an old fencing trick, learned in
Angelo&#8217;s school of arms, swift as a flashlight,
lit within my brain. I leant forward as
though to meet him like a boxer, then,
as he rushed upon me, turned quickly sideways,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
fencing fashion, and slipped half a foot
backward. He missed me by a hand&#8217;s
breadth; a reek of tobacco touched me
hotly on the cheek; another moment and
I had leapt forward on a late &#8216;time thrust,&#8217;
and caught my antagonist neatly just behind
the ear. I had been unable to put any
strength into the blow, but it proved to be
enough to upset his poise. He staggered,
stooped, and then fell headlong on the path,
scarce having time to break his fall with hand
or arm.
</p>

<p>
He lay there for a moment or two,
apparently half-dazed; then, slowly picking
himself up, leant back with folded arms
against an apple-tree, and surveyed me with
a sort of sulky resignation.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, you&#8217;ve got the better o&#8217; me again,&#8217;
said he; &#8216;you&#8217;ve the luck on your side, nae
doot. &#8220;Bing lay your shero,&#8221;&#8217; I overheard him
mutter to himself under his breath, which,
taken in conjunction with his name, amply
sufficed to confirm my conjecture of his gipsy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
origin. &#8216;What is &#8217;t ye want wi&#8217; me?&#8217; he
continued, in a louder voice.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;As I said before,&#8217; I replied slowly, seating
myself upon a wooden bench in front of the
arbour, &#8216;I only require fair play for my
friend within. A man of the world like
yourself can easily deceive him, even to
the half of his kingdom; and if he has a
fancy to cure the leopard of his spots or
whitewash the Ethiopian&#8212;or perhaps I might
say the &#8220;Egyptian&#8221; rather&#8212;I would like the
process to be as inexpensive as possible to
him&#8212;you understand?&#8217; I queried of my
opposite, smiling as I spoke; for I had the
whip-hand of him undoubtedly, and to be
unpleasant politely is part of the lawyer&#8217;s art.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;To put the matter more clearly still,&#8217; I
continued, for he had made no response
to my suggestion, &#8216;I think a week of fresh
air and quiet seclusion in the country should
be enough for any man of active habits after
a period of enforced leisure; the hair, moreover,
grows quickly in a country retreat,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
as Joshua&#8217;s messengers found of old, and,
briefly, what I would advise is a moonlight
flitting.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Pleased with the brevity of my peroration,
I took my cigarette-case from my pocket,
and, having selected a cigarette, carefully
proceeded to light it with the utmost deliberation.
</p>

<p>
I had taken my eyes off him for the
moment, partly in order to ascertain if the
cigarette were properly alight, partly to
perfect the illusion of <i xml:lang="fr">sang froid</i>; and dearly
I paid for my rashness, for with a bound he
was upon me.
</p>

<p>
I ducked; but it was too late, and over I
went backward, my enemy a-top of me, crash
through the arbour on to the stone flagging
within.
</p>

<p>
I was stunned, I suppose, for a minute or
so, for I lay there wondering what had
happened, and annoyed that a wasp, as I
thought, should have stung me in the neck.
In another moment I had discovered that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the smart was due to a bit of live cigarette-ash
that had chanced to drop inside my
collar in my fall, and I tried to put up a hand
to remove it. To my disgust, I found my
hands were knotted tightly together; my
legs, too, were bound, and, as I turned my
head, my eyes met those of my enemy,
sitting beside me on a low stool.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The gadgi&#8217; (viz., &#8216;gorgio,&#8217; or man of non-gipsy
race) &#8216;is but a fool in his pride and self-conceit,&#8217;
said he; &#8216;he is but a tortoise, for all
his pushkin&#8217;s (hare) gallop at the start.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
This was what I heard him saying as I
recovered consciousness, and as I knew that
gipsies always hide their origin, and refrain
from their language in the presence of the
&#8216;gorgios,&#8217; I felt certain he must be labouring
under great excitement, and momentarily
expected to see him out with his knife and
finish me there and then. Here he stooped,
and I thought my hour had come, but
apparently it was only to pick up my fallen
cigarette. Pinching off the blackened end,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
he put it between his lips, and, lighting it at
the other end, drew in deep breaths of
tobacco-smoke.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I don&#8217;t wonder you enjoy it,&#8217; said I, as I
watched his proceedings with an intense
annoyance; &#8216;successful theft is pleasant to a
tchor (thief), I presume?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;And who&#8217;s the tchor in the end,&#8217; retorted
he&#8212;&#8216;you or me? Speak, little gutterwhelp
from the toon, that art paid to lie at so many
bars (sovereigns) the lie. Your kind take a
man&#8217;s money, plead so ill that at the finish
the &#8220;stande&#8221; (gaol) has him, while the big
thief&#8217;s left behind in court wi&#8217; a white wig on,
an&#8217; a smile on his ugly moi (mouth). Who&#8217;s
the tchor, then?&#8217; he repeated with a leer, as
he blew a cloud of smoke in the air. &#8216;I
&#8217;low ye got me nabbed at York &#8217;Sizes, but
it wesn&#8217;t yor doin&#8217;, &#8217;twas that dirty Jack
Spraggon, who turned informer an&#8217; legged
me that time. Why, ye pink-eyed toon&#8217;s-spawn,
if I&#8217;d my rights, an&#8217; things were
as they aince was, I&#8217;d hang ye tae the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
nearest tree. Look there,&#8217; he cried, as,
stirring me with his foot, he drew up his
coat-sleeve and thrust a tattoed wrist over
my eyes&#8212;&#8216;look there, d&#8217;ye ken what that
is?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
I gazed with interest, for it was evidently
an heraldic coat, excellently well punctured
in his flesh.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;A lion rampant within a tressure fleury
counter fleury, by Jove! debruised by a bar
sinister,&#8217; I murmured aloud.
</p>

<p>
My thoughts went back at a bound to
memories of the &#8216;Gaberlunzie Man&#8217; of the
ballad, the errant James V., and &#8216;ane louit
Johnnie Faa, Lord and Earl of Little Egypt,&#8217;
but all I said was, &#8216;Still, people don&#8217;t boast
of an illegitimate origin nowadays.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Illegitimate!&#8217; he cried angrily; &#8216;I&#8217;ll teach
ye manners, ye &#8212;&#8212;&#8217; but here a step sounded
on the path outside, and in another moment
my host peered in at the doorway.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Tut&#8212;tut&#8212;tut,&#8217; said my friend, removing
his glasses from his nose in his agitation,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
&#8216;dear, dear! what can have happened?
Speak, Ned; explain, Will.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
My adversary rose to his feet, saluted our
interrogator somewhat shamefacedly, and,
pointing to myself, replied, &#8216;He wes sae
impiddent wi&#8217; me I&#8217;d just tae teach him a
lesson, but nae harm&#8217;s done.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Oh,&#8217; cried my little friend, and he
positively wrung his hands in his distress,
&#8216;but you shouldn&#8217;t,&#8217; and here he looked
at us reproachfully in turn. Then a happy
thought seemed to rise in his brain. &#8216;We
must forget all about this unhappy occurrence,&#8217;
cried he; &#8216;we will not inquire into it,
but will shake hands all round, and begin
afresh.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
So saying he immediately knelt down,
undid my bandages, and helped me to rise
from the floor. &#8216;Now,&#8217; he cried, and seized
hold of our respective hands.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well,&#8217; said my antagonist, &#8216;I bear no
malice, but keep yor tongue a bit civiler i&#8217;
future.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
&#8216;And refrain from pheasants and legs of
mutton,&#8217; I nearly retorted, but stayed my
tongue in time, and the three of us shook
hands promptly all round, as desired. I was
willing enough to shake hands because I felt
I had been in error in taunting my antagonist,
but I was not prepared for the reproof my
host had in store for me, as he put his arm
through mine, and led me away for a stroll
up the brae.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Oh, how could you do it?&#8217; he said.
&#8216;You must have stung him beyond endurance,
and you promised, you remember,
to respect him.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I only told him the truth,&#8217; I replied
sulkily. &#8216;As a matter of fact, I recognised
in him the first individual I ever had the
pleasure of getting convicted&#8212;at York
Assizes&#8212;pheasant-poaching, stoning a
keeper, etc. One&#8217;s first conviction is like
one&#8217;s first love&#8212;one can&#8217;t forget it.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Ah, but if it is so, that is just an incident
in that past career of his which is quite dead
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and buried now; you see yourself how
annoyed he was at your bringing it up
against him. Of course, his conduct was
inexcusable,&#8217; he hastily added, suddenly
remembering doubtless that he was my host,
&#8216;but this vigour of resentment proves to my
mind the genuineness of his repentance.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
It was hopeless to argue, so I turned the
subject, inwardly resolving that I would
leave on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
After supper that evening I went outside
to smoke, and there lingered long, enjoying
the soft, luminous northern twilight.
</p>

<p>
The murmur of the stream in the valley
trembled amidst the silence of the night, as
of some old monk telling his beads in the
solitude of a vast cathedral. Suddenly a
discordant singing sounded down the vale.
&#8216;Some roysterer,&#8217; thought I with disgust.
&#8216;I suppose there must have been a wedding
or some festivity of that sort.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
The sounds rose and fell fitfully, but grew
gradually louder. It was evident someone
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
was coming &#8216;up the wattor,&#8217; and I waited to
see who the disturber of our quiet could be.
</p>

<p>
The last corner had apparently been
turned, for now I could hear the voice
distinctly. &#8216;The protégé again, by Jove!&#8217;
I groaned.
</p>

<p>
I meditated instant flight, but a fit of
laughter caught me, and I stayed. Out of
the gray twilight a toper lurched up to the
gate on which I leant, and, steadying himself,
momentarily peered into my face.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;No malish, little Wool-shack, eh?&#8217; quoth
he with a grin. Then, becoming confidential,
he leant forward and whispered, &#8216;Drink ye
for a &#8220;bar,&#8221; turn an&#8217; turn about,&#8217; producing
as he spoke a most suspicious-looking black
bottle.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Look here,&#8217; said I, &#8216;why did you come to
this place?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It&#8217;s a free-sh country,&#8217; replied my opposite
solemnly, &#8216;an&#8217; wanderin&#8217;s my trade, an&#8217; the
wee big bairn upstairs, he&#8217;s ta&#8217;en a sort o&#8217;
woman&#8217;s fancy for us. Noo, Wull Blythe&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
like his ancient forbears, royal Wull Faa, an&#8217;
the lave, an&#8217; he cannot say nae to a woman,
though he&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er tak&#8217; a look frae a man.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well, good-night,&#8217; I said, &#8216;and don&#8217;t wake
the big bairn upstairs.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
It was some time before I finished packing,
and after that was done I sat down and had
another pipe by the window. I was just
dozing off when a smell of burning seemed to
creep in upon my nostrils, and the atmosphere
grew thicker to my sub-consciousness.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It can&#8217;t be anything,&#8217; I murmured inwardly,
and tried to recede still further into
the dark grove of sleep, but a step outside
my door effectually roused me.
</p>

<p>
A light gleamed upon me. &#8216;Come, my
friend, come quick; I fear the house is on
fire,&#8217; cried my host at the doorway; &#8216;throw
on a coat, wet your blankets, and follow me
upstairs at once with them.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
I rushed upstairs headlong some few
seconds after, and stumbled over a prostrate
form on the small garret landing, a reek of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
whisky giving me assurance of its identity.
I rose hastily, and passed into the room
beyond, where, amidst heavy smoke-wreaths,
I perceived my host, now beating burning
bedding with his hands, and again stamping
with his feet upon smouldering coverings on
the floor.
</p>

<p>
I did my best to help him, and we
succeeded shortly in getting the better of the
conflagration. After emptying buckets of
water over bed and bedding, we waited for
some minutes to ascertain if any hidden fire
lingered anywhere.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;I think it will be all right now,&#8217; said my
host; &#8216;but come, we must look after my
poor friend outside&#8212;I fear he is badly
burned. Poor fellow, he was lying in bed
stupefied with the smoke. I suppose he
must have fallen asleep reading, and the
candle must have set fire somehow to the
bed-clothes or curtain.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
He had scarcely finished speaking when
he swayed suddenly, and before I could reach
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
out an arm, had fallen to the ground in a
dead faint. I lifted him up and carried him
downstairs at once, and found that he was
rather severely burnt about the hands.
</p>

<p>
After I had restored him to consciousness
as best I could and dressed his hurts, I
proceeded, at my friend&#8217;s earnest entreaty, to
look after the protégé, who was still lying
prostrate on the garret landing; absolutely
unconscious and hopelessly intoxicated.
</p>

<p>
He was badly burnt on one arm, and
scorched down one side of his body. Appearances
seemed to show that he must have
thrown off the counterpane and blankets on
to the floor, that there they must have
become ignited either from his fallen pipe or
candle, and eventually have set fire to one
side of the bed.
</p>

<p>
The doctor had to be sent for, and for a
week the protégé was kept in bed; when he
did come down again he was as contrite as
possible, and I carefully avoided all mention
of the disaster, for I had a dim feeling of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
guilt in the matter, suspecting that he went
down the valley that evening to the alehouse
in consequence of his excitement at his
triumph over myself.
</p>

<p>
Now that he was about again, and my
friend too was quite restored, I determined
to depart, and the next morning went down
early to the Frolic to enjoy a last bathe.
</p>

<p>
I was sitting on a shelf of rock above a
deep pool, drying myself slowly after my
swim, when I heard sounds below me.
Looking out from my shelter, I saw Blythe,
who appeared to be about to follow my
example. His procedure, however, was
curious; for first he cast his cap upon the
waters, then carefully deposited what looked
to me like a Bible on his coat on the
bank, and, finally, having looked about him
stealthily, took off his shoes and proceeded
to ford the burn.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He&#8217;s off,&#8217; I thought to myself, then cried
to him, &#8216;Holloa! what&#8217;s up?&#8217;
</p>

<p>
He stood stock-still in mid-stream like one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
petrified, then, perceiving me, waded slowly
to shore.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Noo, don&#8217;t ye blab tae Mistor Rutherford,&#8217;
he said, as he came close up underneath
where I was standing. &#8216;I&#8217;s awa aff. I
cannot stay, but I doot the little man will
be sair troubled aboot it, sae let him think
on as that I&#8217;m drooned, wi&#8217; the Bible there
tae show I&#8217;s a convarted character, for he&#8217;s
been one tae many for Blythe, an&#8217; I wud&#8217;na
like him tae grieve ower my disappointing
him. I cam&#8217; for a bit fun, but it&#8217;s turning
tae seriousness noo, an&#8217; I can&#8217;t bide any mair,
that&#8217;s a sartinty.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
I don&#8217;t know whether I acted wrongly or
not, but I fell in with his view of the situation,
and when I had finished my dressing he had
already stolen out of sight.
</p>

<p>
I stayed on another week after this, and
during that time successfully concealed my
connivance at the protégé&#8217;s flight.
</p>

<p>
The discovery of his cap and coat was
considered proof of his having been drowned,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and the Bible, borrowed from himself for the
occasion, provided at once a consolation for
my friend and a rebuke to my scepticism.
</p>

<p>
I spent a night in Oldcastle on my way
back to town, and chance took me through
one of the most thickly populated, though
not most aristocratic, quarters of the city.
It was a fine night, and I had prolonged my
stroll unconsciously. Suddenly the swing-door
of a public-house was thrown back
violently, and a man came hurtling through,
and fell with a thud on the pavement beside
me; a face peered through the aperture of
the doors for a moment, and in a flash I
recognised it.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman who had been thus ignominiously
&#8216;chucked out&#8217; slowly pulled himself
together, collected his faculties and his
hat with difficulty, uttered some violent and
abusive epithets, then slowly staggered off
down the street with drunken dignity.
</p>

<p>
I went inside the aforesaid doors. My
eyes had not deceived me, for there was the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
protégé behind the counter in his new capacity
of barman and &#8216;chucker out.&#8217; He signed to
me to follow him into the &#8216;snug,&#8217; and there
confided to me that he had got a permanent
job for the first time in his life.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Here,&#8217; said he, &#8216;is a bar&#8217; (sovereign);
&#8216;send it along tae Mister Rutherford, an&#8217;
tell him I&#8217;s alive an&#8217; hearty, an&#8217; that I canna
rest till I&#8217;s paid for the blankets an&#8217; beddin&#8217;
I burnt the other week. Mind,&#8217; says he,
&#8216;ye&#8217;re not tae say where I am, but tell him
I&#8217;ve a situation, an&#8217;s givin&#8217; satisfaction.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Well,&#8217; thought I to myself, as I returned
to my hotel, &#8216;if my friend hasn&#8217;t reformed
the protégé, he has come at all events as
near to success as is good for the ordinary
mortal.&#8217;
</p>

<p class="pagenum-h-p"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE SPANISH DOUBLOON</h2>

<p>
Ransacking Jake&#8217;s treasury one
afternoon, I made an unexpected find&#8212;no
less than a Spanish doubloon hidden
away in an old sporran of a great-uncle of his.
</p>

<p>
The history of the fox-marked rapier, of
the blood-stained tress of hair found at
Cawnpore, and of the yellow robe of the
Brahmin, I knew already; but the heavy
Spanish coin suggested something of a
different order.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Come,&#8217; said I, holding it up so as to
attract his attention, &#8216;tell me the tale connected
with this&#8212;something to do with a
pirate, or the Spanish Main, I dare swear.&#8217;
</p>

<p>
Jake smiled quaintly as he fingered the
coin with deliberation. &#8216;Weel, it&#8217;s a queer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
tale, sartinly, that&#8217;s connected wi&#8217; yon coin,
but all I can tell ye is what my aunt telled
me langsyne, when she presented it to me
on my joining the sarvice, just before I left
for India.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Noo, my aunt, ye mun ken, was a widow
woman who lived on a bit property she had
left her doon at the small, ootlandish-named
seaport, as it was then, o&#8217; Bocca Chica, on
the Northumberland coast.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was a man there she kenned nicely&#8212;in
fact, she aye said afterwards, wi&#8217; a
shudder at the thocht o&#8217;t, that at one time
he wanted to marry wi&#8217; her&#8212;who cut a big
figure i&#8217; the place, by name Isaac Stephenson&#8212;&#8220;Black
Isaac,&#8221; as he was mair usually
styled. It seems he had been bred and born
i&#8217; the place, but had run awa to sea i&#8217; his
youth, an&#8217; after many voyagings here an&#8217;
there turns up again wi&#8217; pockets fu&#8217; o&#8217; siller,
and a wee, misbegotten heathen dwarf o&#8217; a
Malay as his attendant.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;The dwarf called hissel&#8217; Chilpo, or some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
such uncanny name, an&#8217; was a kind o&#8217; body-servant
an&#8217; clerk an&#8217; dirty-job man to Isaac.
But Isaac never let on where he picked him
up, an&#8217; Chilpo was a sour-tempered little deil,
whom maist folks were terrified o&#8217;; sae naebody
e&#8217;er kenned muckle o&#8217; his antecedents
or ancestry.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Weel, Isaac, on his settling doon again at
home, set up i&#8217; business as a shipowner an&#8217;
broker, an&#8217; carried on a large business as an
exporter o&#8217; coals, an&#8217; did a bit, as maist
everybody did i&#8217; those days, i&#8217; the smuggling
line&#8212;salt, an&#8217; lace, an&#8217; brandy, ye ken. He
had siller, as I said, when he started his new
trade, though naebody kenned hoo he had
come by it; but it was no lang before he was
the richest man i&#8217; the toon, an&#8217; folk began to
talk weel o&#8217; him, an&#8217; praise him up as a good
citizen as was a credit to the toon, an&#8217; ask
him to open bazaars for them, an&#8217; suchlike.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was just one strange thing aboot
him, an&#8217; that was that the womenfolk couldn&#8217;t
abide him. E&#8217;en after he had made hisself
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the richest man i&#8217; the toon, he could ne&#8217;er
get hissel&#8217; married, though &#8217;twas said my
aunt, when he took up wi&#8217; religion, had aince
had a thocht o&#8217; him, but no for lang, for there
was suthin&#8217; aboot him that tarrified her when
it came near the point.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;He was no ill-favoured neither, for I
mind seein&#8217; him mysel&#8217; as a lad aince I was
stayin&#8217; wi&#8217; my aunt&#8212;a tall, poo&#8217;erfu&#8217;, black-haired
man, wi&#8217; heavy eyebrows, an&#8217; a lustfu&#8217;
sort o&#8217; eye&#8212;half hectorin&#8217;, half cowardly.
But he had a cruel sort o&#8217; look aboot him&#8212;thick-lipped,
an&#8217; greedy, sweaty sort o&#8217; hands.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Weel, after a good few years o&#8217; prosperity
he turned sort o&#8217; sickly-like, an&#8217; for the first
time i&#8217; his life began to think upon his latter
end, an&#8217; at the finish takes up wi&#8217; a sect o&#8217;
Bible Christians, or Christadelphians, or some
such body, who were glad to get hold o&#8217;
such a rich, influential sort o&#8217; person withoot
askin&#8217; ower mony questions.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Weel, he gans to his chapel, an&#8217; he
prays, an&#8217; he gies his testimony, an&#8217; calls
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
hissel&#8217; all sorts o&#8217; names, but was ay cautious
no to gie ower mony details o&#8217; his sins, an&#8217;
the good folk were highly edified by it, my
aunt amangst them, an&#8217; asked him for subscriptions
for every sort o&#8217; charity.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;But Chilpo, he couldna stand this sudden
right-about-face, for there was nae releegion
at aal i&#8217; his wee, misshapen anatomy,
naething but love o&#8217; siller, and beastly,
secretive pleasures o&#8217; opium drams an&#8217; such
like. An&#8217; he mutinies against it, an&#8217; cusses
an&#8217; swears to hissel&#8217; i&#8217; his pigeon-English
talk, for Isaac by degrees began to hae his
doots aboot the lawfu&#8217;ness o&#8217; smugglin&#8217; an&#8217;
saeforth, an&#8217; Chilpo&#8217;s wages an&#8217; profits dootless
wud suffer by his maister&#8217;s scruples.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Consequence was, there grew to be bad
blood betwixt maister an&#8217; man, an&#8217; folk could
hear them quarrelling inside the office o&#8217;
nights, till at the finish there&#8217;s a grand flare-up,
Isaac seemingly strikin&#8217; Chilpo, an&#8217; Chilpo
clickin&#8217; his maister wi&#8217; his knife.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Chilpo gets the bag for that, Isaac no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
daurin&#8217; to prosecute him, for he kenned ower
muckle. But he disna leave the toon; just
hangs aboot, doggin&#8217; Isaac&#8217;s footsteps, an&#8217;
cussin&#8217; to hissel&#8217; i&#8217; his queer, ootlandish way
o&#8217; talk. &#8220;Him coward,&#8221; he would mutter,
&#8220;but Chilpo brave man. He no take no
blowee. Chilpo hang Isaac&#8212;hang himselfee&#8212;no
matter&#8212;Chilpo fear nozzin&#8217;,&#8221; an&#8217; he
would gnash wi&#8217; his white teeth savagely
like a mad dog as he saw Isaac pass along
the street.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;His heart was just as black as his sweaty,
black phiznommy, an&#8217; he properly haunted
Isaac till he fair plagued him to death.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;One Sabbath, when there was a great
function on at Isaac&#8217;s chapel, he actually
follows him in, an&#8217; sat sneerin&#8217; an&#8217; mimickin&#8217;
an&#8217; makin&#8217; game o&#8217; Isaac as he prayed an&#8217;
groaned, an&#8217; confessed to bein&#8217; a muckle
great sinner i&#8217; the past, till Isaac was near
mad wi&#8217; rage an&#8217; terror. He tried to pray,
but the words wouldn&#8217;t come richt, an&#8217; the
sweat poured aff his brow, they said, till folk
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
thought he was about to hae a fit or seizure
o&#8217; some sort.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;At the finish he gies it up, an&#8217;, staggerin&#8217;
on to his feet, points i&#8217; a frenzied sort o&#8217; way
to Chilpo sittin&#8217; there below him, an&#8217; cries oot
loud: &#8220;It&#8217;s the deil, it&#8217;s the deil! Drive
him awa; drive him oot o&#8217; the holy place!
I tell ye he&#8217;s sin hissel&#8217;. See the sooty face
on him!&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Ugh! Black Isaac, him coward!&#8221; shouts
Chilpo, standin&#8217; up on his seat. &#8220;Him sky-pilot
nowee, no goodee any more. Once a
timee diffelent; good pilate once, grand pilate
with Chilpo; men&#8217;s pilate, women&#8217;s pilates,
temple&#8217;s pilates, all sorts pilates. Oh yez;
huzza! Dam good timee then; ping-pang,
click-click, plenty moneys, plenty grogs,
plenty funee. O yez; Chilpo, he knowee.&#8221;
The little heathen chuckled to himself, makin&#8217;
uncanny motions wi&#8217; his hands o&#8217; throat-cuttin&#8217;
an&#8217; liquor-drinkin&#8217; an&#8217; fillin&#8217; his pockets wi&#8217;
siller.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;&#8220;Him hipple-clite nowee,&#8221; continued
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Chilpo, shoutin&#8217; aloud to all the chapel-folks
who hadn&#8217;t recovered theirsels from their
amazement; &#8220;dam hipple-clite! Why, him
worship the debbil like Chilpo former timee.
Him no use for prayee; him dam-ee, curs-ee;
him Church&#8217;s pilate, women&#8217;s pilate, then
burnee together. Oh yes, him lemember
allight; askee him,&#8221; an&#8217; wi&#8217; that he points
his finger at Isaac, whose face was workin&#8217;
in a frightful fashion, his eyes starin&#8217; this
way an&#8217; that, wi&#8217; no meanin&#8217; i&#8217; them, his lips
black, an&#8217; his mouth slobberin&#8217;; then sudden
he starts to run, but catches his foot an&#8217;
falls full length doon on the floor an&#8217; drums
wi&#8217; his hands amangst the cushions.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;There was a panic at that; half o&#8217; the
women faints dead awa, the bairns scream,
and some o&#8217; the men drives Chilpo, still
chucklin&#8217; to himself, oot at the door wi&#8217;
blows, whilst others attend to Isaac lyin&#8217;
wi&#8217; his head covered i&#8217; the dusty cushions an&#8217;
his hands hard a-grip o&#8217; the seat-stanchions.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;They loosens his grasp wi&#8217; difficulty, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
lifts him up at the finish wi&#8217; a shockin&#8217; face
on him, an&#8217; a senseless tongue that babbled
aboot a parrot. Some said it mun ha&#8217; been
i&#8217; reference someway to some wicked episode
i&#8217; his past life which Chilpo kenned o&#8217; an&#8217;
alluded to i&#8217; the chapel. Maybe a parrot had
been left the sole survivor after a sack, ye
ken, an&#8217; Isaac couldna forget the scene. Anyways,
Chilpo, the dam cunnin&#8217; little de&#8217;il,
kenned o&#8217; the hidden sore i&#8217; Isaac&#8217;s mind,
an&#8217; laid a cruel finger on &#8217;t wi&#8217; the blackest
malice. An&#8217; there was nae doot aboot the
outcome o&#8217;t, for Isaac was gone clean daft,
an&#8217; died not long afterwards i&#8217; the asylum.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Weel, they gied him a big buryin&#8217;, for his
brethren i&#8217; the chapel said they believed he
was a true repentant sinner, an&#8217; forbye that
he had left a good bit siller amangst them,
which would dootless assist them to that conclusion;
an&#8217; as there had been some body-snatchin&#8217;
lately, they determined to form a
small watch committee to keep guard at the
graveside for a night or two.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
&#8216;Weel, the watch was composed o&#8217; some
decent elderly folk, who didn&#8217;t trash theirselves
ower the job; an&#8217; mevvies the funeral
festivities had delayed them a bit, for they
didn&#8217;t arrive at the graveyard till aboot half-past
ten o&#8217; the clock.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;It was ane o&#8217; thae tempestuous October
nights, wi&#8217; half a gale blowin&#8217;, an&#8217; clouds
gallopin&#8217;, wi&#8217; flittin&#8217;s o&#8217; moonlight like jockeys
ridin&#8217; &#8217;em; an&#8217; when they came nigh to
the graveside, an&#8217; saw a dark, misshapen
sort o&#8217; a figure plyin&#8217; an axe vigorously, an&#8217;
heard a thud, thud, same as ye may when
passin&#8217; by a butcher&#8217;s shop any day, why,
they turned tail and fled, the most o&#8217; them
stumblin&#8217; this way an&#8217; that amangst the
headstones.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;Two o&#8217; them, though, was a bit bolder,
an&#8217; pressed on up to the graveside, whereupon
the little black demon figure thuds
doon his axe wi&#8217; a sickenin&#8217; sound, then
dives awa into the darkness, screechin&#8217; oot:
&#8220;Chilpo, Chilpo! he makee sicker, he makee
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
sicker!&#8221; and therewith vanished frae Bocca
Chica.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;As for the doubloon,&#8217; concluded Jake,
spinning it into the air as he spoke, &#8216;it was
found amangst some leavin&#8217;s o&#8217; Chilpo&#8217;s at
his lodgin&#8217;s, an&#8217; sold wi&#8217; some other trinkets
to pay some small debts he had left behind
him.
</p>

<p>
&#8216;My aunt bought it up as a memento o&#8217;
the marcifu&#8217; preservation she had had frae
marryin&#8217; wi&#8217; a buccaneer; an&#8217; when I said
good-bye to her on startin&#8217; for India, she
presented it to me, wi&#8217; an admonition ne&#8217;er
to have any traffic wi&#8217; dwarfs or pirates.&#8217;

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
